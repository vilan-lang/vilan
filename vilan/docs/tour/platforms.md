# Platforms

One language, several runtimes. A package builds for **Node** (the
default), **Deno**, **Bun**, or the **browser**: set `target` in
`vilan.toml`, or pass `--platform` on the CLI.

The standard library is layered so each build only uses what its
platform can do. Call a server function from code a browser build can
reach, and you get a clear compile error naming the call chain, not a
runtime crash. That's the whole idea of this chapter.

## The std layers

- **Base**: platform-neutral, available everywhere (collections,
  `Option`/`Result`, strings, numbers, `reactive`, `shared`, `time`,
  json/wire/binary, the rpc client machinery, `style`, `fetch`,
  `crypto`, and friends).
- **Browser layer**: `std::dom`, `std::ui`, `std::router`,
  `std::storage`. Browser builds only.
- **Process layer** (Node/Deno/Bun): `std::db`, `std::http`, `std::fs`,
  `std::process`, `std::rpc_server`. Server builds only.

## Full-stack packages

A client + server app fits in **one package** with two entries: each
`[entry.<name>]` names an entry file and the platform it builds for.
This is the default shape; reach past it only when you have a reason:

```toml
[package]
name = "app"

[entry.client]
target = "browser"

[entry.server]
# target defaults to node; path defaults to <name>.vl under src/
```

```
app/
  vilan.toml
  src/
    client.vl     the browser entry
    server.vl     the node entry
    store.vl      the service, next to its resources
    todo.vl       shared types — anything both entries import
```

`vilan build` compiles every entry for its own target into `dist/` —
`<name>.mjs` for a process entry, `<name>.js` for a browser one
(browser entries first, so a server that ships bundles finds them
fresh); `vilan run` builds everything and starts the one
Node entry; `vilan check` checks all entries, always. Reachability does
the sorting: the same `store.vl` may use `std::fs` freely, because only
the server entry reaches into it. If client code ever calls that far,
the build fails with the call chain.

The advanced form, for larger apps, is a workspace of packages (a
shared `[library]` for payload types, a browser package, a server
package), where each member has its own manifest and dependency set,
and may declare its own entries:

```
app/
  vilan.toml       [project] packages = ["common", "client", "server"]
  common/          [library] — payload types (base layer only)
  client/          [package] target = "browser"
  server/          [package] (node)
```

`vilan build .` at the root builds every member the same way. The
compiler checks each against its own platform, including that `common`
stays platform-neutral. In either shape, the service lives next to its
resources (see [Services](../guide/services.md)).

> **Going deeper.** Where a team wants an explicit boundary,
> `[platform("browser")]` on a function declares the platforms it
> promises to run on. The compiler checks the promise on every compile

> build. Patterns use the manifest layers' vocabulary: `"node"`,
> `"browser"`, families like `"@process"`, or several at once for code
> that must stay neutral. The editor shows the same information as you
> write: violations appear as live diagnostics at the offending call, and
> hovering a function shows its inferred requirement and how it got it,
> e.g. ``requires the `process` layer of `std` (via `save → write_file
> (std::fs)`)``.

## Externs: talking to the host

You'll mostly consume host bindings through std. But when you need a
Node API or browser API that std doesn't wrap yet, you can bind it
yourself with an extern declaration. This is how std's own bindings
are written:

```vilan,fragment
// A function from a host module (node:crypto):
[extern("node:crypto", "randomBytes")]
external fun random_bytes_sync(length: i32): HashBuffer;

// An opaque host object, with methods bound one by one:
external struct HashBuffer;
impl HashBuffer {
	[extern(method, "toString")]
	external fun to_string_encoded(self, encoding: str): str;
}

// An async host function — promise-returning; callers implicitly await:
[extern("node:timers/promises", "setTimeout")]
async external fun sleep(ms: i32): void;
```

The four binding forms:

| Form | Binds |
|---|---|
| `[extern("module", "name")]` | an import from a host module |
| `[extern("global.path")]` | a dotted global, like `history.pushState` |
| `[extern(method, "name")]` | a method on a host object |
| `[extern(get, "prop")]` / `[extern(set, "prop")]` | a property read / write |

Keep externs in platform-specific packages (they are host-specific by
nature). When a binding proves itself, consider promoting it into std
rather than copying it between apps.

## Assets

Browser builds produce `<entry>.js`, plus `<entry>.css` when styles
were emitted. Your server serves those two files and an HTML shell; the
[services guide](../guide/services.md) shows the standard fallback
shape.

> **Going deeper.** Build assets come from `std::asset::emit(kind,
> content)`, callable only during `const` evaluation. The styling
> system's `const style()` chains call it to write CSS rules. Libraries
> can also declare platform overlays of their own (a base root plus
> per-platform roots in `[library.layer]`), which is how std itself is
> layered; most libraries never need this.
