# Spec §8 — Contexts

A **context** is a dynamically-scoped value: established for the dynamic
extent of a body, readable from anything that runs within that extent,
invisible outside it. Contexts are Vilan's answer to ambient parameters
(the current reactive owner, the current turn, the enclosing nursery)
without global mutable state and without threading a parameter by hand
through every signature.

Contexts are **compiled away**. The implementation threads each
context's value as a hidden parameter through exactly the functions and
closures that transitively read it; there is no runtime storage, no
async-local machinery, and a program that never creates a context pays
nothing. Everything in this chapter is checked at compile time.

## 8.1 The model

`std::context::Context<T>` is the handle (appendix §A.4, a lang item:
the compiler keys on its operations). A context is created once, at
module level, and referred to by that name:

```vilan,fragment
let flavor: Context<i32> = Context::new();
```

- `flavor.run(value, body)` (establish): `value` is the context's value
  for the **dynamic extent** of `body` (the closure's execution and
  everything it calls, transitively). `run` yields `body`'s value.
- `flavor.get()` (the **strict** read): yields the established `T`.
- `flavor.get_safe()` (the **safe** read): yields `Option<T>`,
  `Some(value)` under an enclosing `run`, `None` otherwise.

`Context::new`, `run`, `get`, and `get_safe` are intrinsics: the
threading pass rewrites their call sites away. They must be applied
directly to the context's **name** (a receiver that is not a named
context is rejected). A context is not otherwise useful as a value:
moving one through a parameter or a field severs the link between its
`run`s and its reads; the reads can then never be covered. `run`'s
body argument must be a closure literal (or an injected closure value,
§8.5).

`Context<T>`'s value type is inferred from its first `run`, exactly as
a `List<T>`'s element type is inferred from `push`.

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::context::Context;

let flavor: Context<i32> = Context::new();

fun describe(): str {
	i"flavor {flavor.get()}"
}

fun main() {
	let inner = flavor.run(7, || {
		print(describe());   // flavor 7 — dynamic extent reaches callees
		flavor.run(9, || describe())
	});
	print(inner);            // flavor 9 — the nearest run wins
}
```

Establishment nests: a read observes the **nearest** enclosing `run`.
Two runs of different contexts are independent.

## 8.2 Reads: strict and safe

The two read forms differ in what they demand of the program, not in
what they return at a covered site:

- A **strict** `get()` demands **coverage** (§8.3): the compiler proves
  every path that reaches it passes through an enclosing `run`. Code
  holding only strict reads carries the bare `T`.
- A **safe** `get_safe()` never demands coverage: uncovered paths
  supply `None`. Code reachable without a `run` carries the value as
  `Option<T>`; at a covered→safe boundary the bare value wraps in
  `Some` automatically.

Strictness is a property of *code regions*, propagated caller-ward: a
function that (transitively) reaches a strict read is strict; a
function whose only demands are safe reads is safe. One function may be
strict for one context and safe for another. Each context threads
independently.

## 8.3 Coverage

For every strict read, the compiler checks, over the whole call graph,
that the reading code cannot be entered without the value. It is a
compile error ("context `…` is read here, but this code can be reached
without an enclosing `run`") when a strict read is reachable from:

- the program's top level or the entrypoint `main` (the uncovered
  roots: `main` is semantically the outermost, run-less extent);
- a module-level initializer;
- any caller chain that does not pass through a `run` of that context.

A call dispatched on a **generic bound** is covered by instantiation:
the compiler resolves each call chain's recorded type bindings — through
generic forwarding functions, recursively — and a needy candidate
implementation demands coverage only of the callers whose instantiation
actually selects it. A chain the compiler cannot resolve (an
unrecorded binding, a function taken as a value or itself reachable
through dispatch) is covered conservatively: the site is treated as
reaching every candidate, so a needy candidate demands coverage of the
caller even if another candidate would have been selected. A call
dispatched on a **concrete receiver's type** (an inherited trait
default) is covered by that receiver: only the members the receiver's
type selects demand coverage — except a `self` call inside a shared
default body, whose receiver is unknowable at the site and which stays
conservative. Dead code, a function with no callers at all, is
exempt (it cannot run uncovered); a function called from top level, or
taken as a value, is entered without the value and is never covered,
whatever its other callers.

The error anchors at **your code**. A strict read you wrote reports at
that read — anywhere in your workspace, an imported sibling module
included. A strict read that sits inside **library code** — a
standard-library helper (`effect`, `map`, and `or` all reach the
ambient owner through one read in `std::reactive`), or a dependency
package's function — reports at each of your calls that enters the
library on an uncovered path, one error per call (a call inside a
covering `run` is never blamed), with a secondary note pointing at the
library-internal read it reaches, in the library's own file.
Library-internal calls never carry labels of their own.

The error also shows the **whole uncovered path**, not just its
endpoint: every call of yours between the program's entry and the
anchor carries its own label ("the context requirement flows through
this call"; at a call dispatched on a generic bound, "may flow through"
— the site might select an implementation that never reads). The labels
run from the outermost frame down toward the read, and a deep chain
elides its tail behind an explicit "… N more uncovered calls on this
path". A covered call is clean: providing the context stops the trace.

A function that reads a context **cannot be used as a value**
("`…` reads context `…`, so it can't be used as a value"): an indirect
call would bypass the hidden parameter. Wrap it in a closure literal at
the use site: the closure captures the channel correctly (§8.4).

Safe reads never fence. In uncovered positions they read `None`; this
is what lets library code ask "is there an ambient X?" from anywhere
(the standard library's spawn registration does exactly this, §7.7).

## 8.4 Closures capture at creation

A closure created inside a covered region **captures the context value
at its creation site**, and the capture is what its body reads,
regardless of where the closure is later called:

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::context::Context;

let flavor: Context<i32> = Context::new();

fun main() {
	let snap = flavor.run(3, || {
		|| flavor.get()   // captures 3 at creation
	});
	print(flavor.run(8, || snap()));   // 3 — not 8
}
```

This is the stability rule §7.5 relies on: ambient values do not shift
across suspensions or across deferred invocation, because the closure's
channel was fixed when it was made. (Contrast dynamic-binding systems
where the *call site's* environment decides; in Vilan only `run`'s
extent and creation sites decide.)

## 8.5 Injected closures: the `context` clause

Capture-at-creation has one structural consequence: a closure literal
passed **to** an establishing function is created *before* the extent
exists, so it would capture the caller's (often absent) value: exactly
wrong for helpers like `nursery(body)` or `run_with_owner(owner, body)`
whose entire purpose is to run the body under a fresh value.

A **`context` clause** on a closure type solves this by *deferring* the
binding to the call site:

```vilan,fragment
fun with_flavor<T>(body: (|| T) context flavor): T {
	flavor.run(7, body)
}
```

A parameter (or `let` binding) whose closure type carries
`context <name>` declares an **injected** closure:

- A closure **literal** supplied to that position does not capture at
  creation; it takes its own hidden parameter, bound anew at each call.
- Each **call through** the injected value demands the context from the
  *caller* like a strict read, and supplies the caller's value.
- An unannotated local binding holding a closure literal, passed into a
  clause position, **adopts** the clause (as if the literal were
  written inline).

Because the binding is deferred, an injected value may only flow where
the threading can follow it: it can be **called**, **forwarded** to a
parameter with the same clause, or passed as **`run`'s body**. Any
other use (storing it in a field, returning it, putting it in a
collection) is a compile error ("an injected (`context`-typed) closure
can only be called, forwarded …, or passed to `run`").

A clause may name several contexts (`context (a, b)`); the clause must
name context bindings, and it composes with the closure-type markers of
§7.4 (`(sync || T) context turn_scope` is the reactive layer's shape).

## 8.6 Interactions

- **Async** (§7.5): captures are fixed at creation, so a context value
  is stable across every suspension of the extent by construction. An
  awaiting `run` body holds its value across its whole chain.
- **Spawns** (§7.7): every spawn site is an implicit *safe* read of the
  standard library's ambient nursery: inside a nursery's extent the
  value is present and the task registers; outside, the read is absent
  and the spawn stays free-floating.
- **Platforms**: the threading pass runs before emission for every
  target; contexts work identically on process and browser platforms
  (no host storage is involved).

## 8.7 The standard library's ambient values (informative)

`std` builds its ambient machinery on this one mechanism: `owner_scope`
(the reactive disposal owner: `run_with_owner`, `comp`),
`turn_scope` (the current write-batching turn: `turn`, `batch`), and
`ambient_nursery` (`std::task`: nursery registration and the
cancellation signal). Their semantics are library contracts, not
language rules; they are specified by their reference pages.
