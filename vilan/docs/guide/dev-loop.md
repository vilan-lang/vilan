# The dev loop

You built an app in the [walkthrough](walkthrough.md). This chapter is about
*iterating* on it — the edit-save-see loop. `vilan run --watch` on a
full-stack project closes that loop with **hot module replacement (HMR)**:
save a source file and the running browser app updates in place, reactive
state intact, without a full page reload.

Nothing here needs the walkthrough app specifically. Any project with a
browser leg will do, and `vilan init my-app --template fullstack` writes
one ([Start a project](../tour/hello-vilan.md#start-a-project)). From the
project directory:

```sh
vilan run --watch .
```

A project with a browser leg prints one extra line at startup:

```text
hmr: dev channel on 127.0.0.1:35917
```

That is the **dev channel** — a tiny local endpoint the browser connects back
to. From then on every save rebuilds all legs and the channel tells the
browser exactly what changed. Nothing new to learn and no separate `dev`
command: `run --watch` already *means* "the dev loop".

## What each edit does

Change detection is by **output bytes**, not by guessing from the source: each
save rebuilds every leg, and the *artifacts* are compared. That makes the
verdict exact.

| You edited… | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Client code** | The browser bundle changes → a **swap**: the new bundle is evaluated in place, module state carried across (below). No reload. |
| **A stylesheet only** | Just the CSS sidecar changed → the stylesheet is **hot-swapped**, no reload, no swap — the page doesn't even flicker. |
| **Server code** | The server bundle changed → the **Node process restarts**. The browser stays connected; its live rpc mirror reconnects on its own (the same backoff that survives a server crash) and resyncs from the server's current values. |
| **Shared code** (a module both entries reach, or a `common` library both legs use) | Both bundles change → the server restarts **and** the browser swaps. The fresh client dials the new contract, so a changed rpc shape never leaves a stale client talking to a new server. |
| **A file with a mistake** | The compile error shows in the terminal *and* as an in-page **overlay** — the real file, line, and message — while the running app keeps its last good build. Fix it and the next good save clears the overlay and swaps normally. |

A server-only edit pushes **nothing** to the browser — the client is
unaffected, so it isn't disturbed. That the Node leg *restarts* rather than
hot-swapping is deliberate: the process is cheap and a fresh start is always
correct, so there is no server-side HMR to reason about.

The error overlay carries the **real diagnostics** — the file, the `line:col`,
the message, and any note — the same text your terminal shows, rendered over the
page so the eyes already on the browser don't miss it. The terminal stays
authoritative; the overlay is the copy, and the next successful save clears it.

## What carries across a swap, and what resets

A swap re-evaluates the whole client bundle. Two things survive it:

- **Module-level state.** Every top-level binding is carried across by its
  key (`package::module::name`) and a fingerprint of its type. A plain-data
  binding carries its value; a module-level `Signal` or `Shared` carries its
  *payload* into a fresh cell. So `mut count` and a module-level list signal
  keep their live contents while you edit the view that renders them.
- **Everything the server holds.** The server doesn't swap — it restarts with
  its state in SQLite (or wherever it lives), and the client's mirror resyncs.
  In a full-stack app that is *most* of your durable state, which is why the
  swap can afford to be simple about the rest.

Top-level bindings like these keep their live values while you edit the view
that renders them:

```vilan,browser
import std::dev;
import std::reactive::Signal;

// Carried across every swap by key + type. Edit main's body, save, and these
// hold their values — only the view re-runs.
mut opened = 0;
let recent: Signal<List<str>> = Signal::new([]);

fun main() {
	opened = opened + 1;
	recent.set(["home"]);
}
```

What resets is state minted **inside functions during mount** — an ephemeral
signal created in a component, the focused element, scroll position,
half-typed text not yet pushed. Fine-grained reactivity gives these no stable
identity to reattach to, so a swap lets them go. A plain browser refresh is the
always-available complete reset.

**The initializer-edit rule.** Editing a binding's *initializer* without
changing its *type* keeps the live value — the new initializer does **not**
run:

```vilan,fragment
mut counter = 0;      // edit this to `mut counter = 100`, save…
// …and `counter` stays at whatever it had climbed to. During iteration the
// value you're watching *is* the work — this is the behavior every mainstream
// hot-reloader converged on.
```

Change the binding's *type*, though, and the old value is the wrong shape:
that binding fresh-initializes (a "fingerprint miss"), which is the correct
answer, not a failure. To carry a value your edit reshapes anyway, or to carry
something minted inside a function, reach for the manual channel —
[`std::dev`](../std/dev.md)'s `stash`/`take`.

## Escape hatches

- **`--no-hmr`** — turn HMR off and get the plain restart-the-whole-app watch
  loop (exactly the pre-HMR behavior). Reach for it if a swap ever surprises
  you and you want the blunt instrument back.
- **`--hmr-port <port>`** — the dev channel defaults to `35917`; change it if
  that port is taken. `--hmr-port 0` asks the OS for any free port and the
  startup line reports the one it got.
- **A browser refresh** is always a full, clean reset — seed state lives only
  in the page's heap, so reloading throws all of it away.

## Picking which server to run

You only need this section if you use the
[workspace shape](../tour/platforms.md#full-stack-packages) — a
`[project]` of several packages. The default one-package app has a single
node entry, so `run` just runs it.

`run` (and `run --watch`) executes one Node leg. A workspace with a single
`node` package needs no help — that one runs. A workspace with **two or more**
`node` packages (say a `server` and a diagnostics `probe`) has to be told which,
with `--entry <name>`:

```sh
vilan run --watch --entry server .
```

Without it, `run` stops and lists the candidates:

```text
error: this workspace has more than one `node` package to run — pick one with --entry <name>: probe, server
```

The non-selected Node legs still **compile** as part of the workspace — their
bundles land in `dist/` and a shared edit still recompiles them — they just
aren't launched. Under `--watch` the browser legs hot-swap exactly as usual; the
chosen server restarts on its own edits, and a change to a leg that isn't running
does nothing visible (its `dist/` bundle refreshes, but nothing restarts). Which
leg is the default is a per-workspace choice we may add to the manifest later;
for now it's the flag.

## The CSS `<link>` idiom

CSS hot-swap works by bumping the cache-buster on your stylesheet `<link>`, so
it needs the stylesheet to *be* a `<link>` to `dist/<leg>.css`:

```text
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/client.css">
```

An app that inlines its CSS into the page instead gets a full **swap** on a
style change rather than the flicker-free stylesheet reload — still correct
(the byte-diff classifies inlined CSS as a bundle change), just not as
surgical. The `<link>` form is the one to prefer for the tightest loop.

## Cleaning up strays

The swap disposes the UI root and closes the live rpc socket for you. Anything
*else* a bundle started outside the reactive system — a raw interval, a bare
task — keeps running after a swap unless you register a cleanup. That, plus
the `stash`/`take` carryover channel and the `hmr_active` guard, is the whole
of [`std::dev`](../std/dev.md).
