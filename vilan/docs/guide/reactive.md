# Reactive state

`std::reactive` is Vilan's state layer. If you've used signals in Solid or
Preact, you'll be at home immediately. If you're coming from React, think
of a signal as a piece of state that components subscribe to directly:
there is no re-render, dependency array, or memoization dance. When a
signal changes, exactly the code that watches it runs.

Four ideas make up the layer, and this chapter takes them in order:

- **Signals** hold values.
- **Effects** run code when signals change.
- **Owners** decide when effects die.
- **Turns** decide when changes become visible.

The UI layer, the rpc mirrors, and the router are all built on these, so
this chapter pays for itself quickly.

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::{ Signal, Owner, run_with_owner };

fun main() {
	let count = Signal::new(0);
	let owner = Owner::new();
	run_with_owner(owner, || {
		count.effect(|value: i32| print(value));
	});
	count.set(1);
	count.set(2);
}
```

## Signals

A `Signal<T>` is a mutable cell whose readers can subscribe to changes.

```vilan,fragment
Signal::new(value: T): Signal<T>       // a fresh signal
signal.get(): T                        // current value
signal.set(value: T)                   // write + notify subscribers
signal.set_with(transform: sync |T| T) // read-modify-write in one step
signal.update(mutate: sync |&mut T| void) // mutate in place + notify once
```

Signals hold **values**. Vilan copies, so `get` hands you a copy, and the
only way to change what subscribers see is a write through the signal
itself. For a collection, `update` is the one you want: the closure gets a
**writable view of the stored value**, so you mutate it directly.

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::Signal;

fun main() {
	let items: Signal<List<str>> = Signal::new([]);
	items.update(|&mut list| {
		list.push("first");
	});
	print(items.get().len());
}
```

The `&mut` in `|&mut list|` is the same view convention a function
parameter takes — it says *this closure mutates the caller's value*, which
is exactly what makes the push land in the signal rather than in a copy.
Subscribers are notified **once**, after the closure returns, whatever it
did (a closure that writes nothing still notifies — `update` is a write,
like `set`). Inside a `batch`, that notification defers and coalesces like
any other write. `update` works for any `T` a closure can mutate: `Map`,
`Set`, a struct's fields, a nested aggregate.

`set_with` remains the read-**transform**-write form, and it still reads
better when you're computing a new value rather than editing one:

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::Signal;

fun main() {
	let count = Signal::new(1);
	count.set_with(|n| n + 4);
	print(count.get());
}
```

(If you tried `items.get().push("first")`, you'd be mutating a copy. The
[memory model](../tour/memory-model.md) chapter explains why that's a
feature.)

## Derived state: `map`, `combine`, `flatten`

Build state as a graph and let it recompute itself:

- `signal.map(transform)` gives a signal of the transformed value:

  ```vilan
  import std::print;
  import std::reactive::Signal;
  fun main() {
  	let count = Signal::new(2);
  	let doubled = count.map(|n: i32| n * 2);
  	print(doubled.get());
  	count.set(5);
  	print(doubled.get());
  }
  ```
- `combine((a, b, …))` gives a signal of the tuple of several
  signals' values. It fires when any of them changes. Takes two or more.
- `nested.flatten()` on a `Signal<Signal<U>>` follows whichever inner
  signal is current, and detaches from a replaced one.

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::{ Signal, combine };

fun main() {
	let first = Signal::new("Ada");
	let last = Signal::new("Lovelace");
	let full = combine((first, last)).map(|pair: (str, str)| {
		let (a, b) = pair;
		a + " " + b
	});
	print(full.get());
	first.set("Grace");
	print(full.get());
}
```

A named function can stand in for the closure (`signal.map(parse)`).
See [functions & closures](../tour/functions-and-closures.md).

## Reacting: `effect` and `sub`

Two ways to run code on change. **Use `effect` by default.**

- `signal.effect(observer)` runs the observer now with the current
  value, re-runs it on every change, and cleans itself up automatically
  when its surrounding UI (or other owner) goes away. Nothing to
  remember.
- `signal.sub(observer): Subscription` is the manual version. It fires
  only on *later* changes, and you keep the `Subscription` and call
  `dispose()` on it yourself.

## Ownership: who cleans up

Every effect is a subscription, and subscriptions must die when the
thing that created them goes away. Otherwise a page you navigated off
keeps reacting forever. That's a memory leak in any reactive system.
Vilan's answer is **owners**, and in normal app
code you never manage them: the UI layer creates owners exactly where
subtrees can die (a mounted root, a list row, a conditional block), and
every `effect` you create automatically registers with the nearest one.

For tests, or when you're building your own machinery:

- `Owner::new()` makes an owner; `owner.dispose()` disposes everything
  registered with it.
- `run_with_owner(owner, || …)` runs a block with that owner ambient.
  Every `effect` inside, however deep in function calls, registers
  into it.
- `get_owner()` reads the ambient owner, e.g. to attach custom cleanup
  with `owner.defer(…)`.

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::{ Signal, Owner, run_with_owner };

fun main() {
	let source = Signal::new(0);
	let owner = Owner::new();
	run_with_owner(owner, || {
		source.effect(|value: i32| print(value));
	});
	source.set(1);
	owner.dispose();
	source.set(2); // not printed: the effect died with its owner
}
```

Creating reactive state *outside* any owner is a compile error. That
sounds strict, but it's the property that makes leaks impossible by
construction, and in practice `mount_root` already gave you an owner
before your first line of UI code ran.

## Turns: when changes become visible

If an event handler sets five signals, you want watchers to see the
final state once, not five intermediate states. Vilan batches writes
into **turns**. Inside a turn, `set` only records. When the turn
settles, each affected watcher runs once with the final values:

```text
click ──▶ the handler runs inside a fresh turn
          │
          │  count.set(1)    ┐
          │  items.set(…)    │   writes are recorded, not delivered
          │  count.set(2)    ┘
          │
          └─ the handler's sync part ends → the turn SETTLES
                 │
                 ├─▶ the count watcher runs once   (sees 2 — never 1)
                 └─▶ the items watcher runs once

one turn  =  one consistent wave, no matter how many writes
```

You mostly never manage turns, because the framework opens them at its
boundaries: every UI event handler runs in one, every `mount_root` build
runs in one, and every rpc handler on the server runs in one. This is
like React's automatic batching, generalized.

For the rare explicit cases:

```vilan,fragment
turn(policy, || …)   // run a block in a fresh turn; an awaiting body HOLDS it
batch(|| …)          // join the current turn, or create one
flush()              // drain the ambient turn early
```

> `turn` adapts to its body: a synchronous body settles when it ends

>
> boundary turn:                   settle ▲              settle ▲
> (a UI event)                     (wave 1)              (wave 2)
>
> turn, awaiting body:                                   settle ▲
>                                                      (one wave)
> ```

> Writes that land after a turn already settled (from spawned work) are
> grouped per continuation segment and drained in a microtask, so you
> never observe half a wave.

## Optimistic writes and local-first drafts

Two ready-made lifecycles for "update the UI now, confirm with the
server after". They differ in what happens on failure, and the
difference is the point:

**`optimistic(signal, value, commit)`** paints the value immediately,
runs your async commit, and on failure rolls back. Use it for
one-shot actions like a delete button: if the delete failed, the row
should come back.

**`draft(initial, commit)`** is for *editing*. It keeps the user's text
on failure (rolling back mid-typing would eat their input) and retries
naturally on the next push. Bind an input to a draft and every keystroke
can safely commit through an rpc:

```vilan,fragment
struct Draft<T> {
	local: Signal<T>,          // bind inputs to this
	state: Signal<DraftState>, // Synced | Dirty | Failed(str)
	…
}
draft(initial: T, commit: async |T| Option<str>): Draft<T>
draft.push(value)   // set local + spawn the commit (never waits on the wire)
draft.adopt(remote) // fold in a remote change
```

The commit closure returns `None` on success or `Some(reason)` on
failure, so an rpc-calling closure drops straight in.

The whole lifecycle in one picture. The input never waits on
the wire, and every remote change funnels through `adopt`'s three rules:

```text
you type ──▶ local (Signal) ──▶ the input shows it INSTANTLY
                │
                └─ push: spawn the commit ──▶ rpc ──▶ server
                                                        │
                          the mirror broadcasts  ◀──────┘
                                │
                             adopt(remote):
                    ├─ same as last synced?  an ECHO — do nothing
                    ├─ local has no edits?   take the remote value
                    └─ local is DIRTY?       your text wins for now
```

```vilan
import std::print;
import std::reactive::{ draft, Draft, DraftState };
import std::option::Option::{ self, Some, None };
import std::shared::Shared;

fun main() {
	let saved: Shared<List<str>> = Shared::new([]);
	let name = draft("seed", |value: str| {
		saved.write().push(value);
		None
	});
	name.push("edit");         // local is "edit" immediately
	print(name.local.get());
	name.adopt("edit");        // the server echoing it back: no-op
	name.adopt("remote-edit"); // a genuine remote change: adopted (local is clean)
	print(name.local.get());
}
```

## Keyed reconciliation

`reconcile(old_keys, old_items, new_items, key)` computes a minimal
update plan for keyed lists (keep this row, refresh that one, these are
gone). It's the pure engine underneath `ui`'s `bind_each`. You'd only
call it directly to build your own list-rendering primitive.

## Traps

- `sub` gives you a `Subscription` to dispose manually. Prefer `effect`
  and let the owner handle it.
- Disposal stops *future* deliveries. A watcher already queued in the
  currently-settling turn may fire one final time.
- Derived signals (`map`/`combine`) live as long as their sources, by
  design. They don't need owners, and they don't leak into disposed
  subtrees.
