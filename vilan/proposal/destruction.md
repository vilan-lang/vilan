## 1. Why now

- **The resource-owner story is the named blocker** for Part B's free-spawn lint
  (`async-polymorphism.md` opens): every remaining free spawn in std is object-lifetime work
  that a function-scoped `nursery` cannot own. Objects need destructors before they can own
  tasks.
- **F3/F4 call C4 the linchpin** of the non-JS memory lowering (allocator + scope-end drops
  + ARC for `Shared`). The semantics must exist — and be exercised on JS — before an
  emitter needs them.
- **It is the last breaking-flavored change on the board.** The affine rules below change
  how resource values bind and pass. Every month adds std surface, and F5/F7 will add
  users; the break is cheapest now (the agreed order: C4 → A13 → F5/F7 → A7).

## 2. The tension, and the shape of the answer

Rule 1 of the memory model says values copy. A droppable value cannot mean anything under
copying: a copied file handle double-closes, a copied refcount miscounts. So destruction
cannot be bolted onto the data world — the world must be partitioned:

- **Data** — everything vilan has today. Copies on binding, elides at last use, reclaimed
  by GC on JS / the stack+arena story on native. **Entirely unchanged by this proposal.**
- **Resources** — a small, explicitly-rooted class with *affine* discipline: a resource
  value has exactly one owner at a time; it **moves** on binding and `own`-passing, is
  **loaned** through the existing view conventions, can never be copied, and its owner's
  scope end runs its destructor.

Rejected shapes:

- **ARC everywhere (Swift)** — retain/release instrumentation on every copy site, on a JS
  backend that needs none of it for data. Pays a global cost for a corner problem.
- **Affine everything (Rust)** — rejected by rev-1 from the start; the move checker's
  complexity lands on every user instead of the advanced corner.
- **Protocol-only (status quo)** — `Disposable`/`Owner` works where a framework drives it
  (UI boundaries), but nothing enforces it, nothing composes it (a struct holding a
  `Database` has no story), and native cannot be built on convention.

The class is **two tiers**. Tier 1 — this proposal, ships on JS — is *unique* resources
(one owner, move-only). Tier 2 — specified in §10, built with the native arc — is
*counted* resources (`Shared` ARC, `Weak`, counted closure environments). The split
exists because counted handles must be closure-capturable (that is `Shared`'s whole job),
and capture-with-release requires counted closure environments — native-arc machinery.
Nothing in Tier 1 forecloses Tier 2.

## 3. Classification — what is a resource

- **`resource` is a declaration modifier** (position like `external`):

  ```vilan
  resource external struct Database;

  resource struct Session {
      db: Database,
      tasks: OwnedNursery,
  }
  ```

- **Containment infers.** An aggregate (struct, enum, tuple, fixed array) with a
  resource field, payload, or element type *is* a resource — recursively, the `Wire`/`Hashable`
  all-fields machinery with the polarity flipped (any resource member marks the whole).
  `Session` above needs no modifier; writing it is legal and checked (declaring
  `resource` on a type is always allowed — intent: "will gain teardown / must not be
  copied" — but omitting it never hides resource-ness).
- **The modifier is required at leaves**: an `external struct` is opaque, so host-object
  resources (`Database`) must say so themselves.
- **`Drop` may be implemented only for resource types** — an impl on a data type errors,
  steering to add `resource` (destruction without move discipline is exactly the
  double-close bug).
- **Per-instantiation for generics**: `Option<Database>` is a resource *instantiation*;
  `Option<i32>` stays data. Resource-ness of a generic type is decided at each
  instantiation, like platform coloring and asyncness bits already are.

## 4. The affine rules

Terminology: *move* = ownership transfer, source binding dead after; *loan* = the existing
second-class view (`self`/`&`/`&mut` conventions), no ownership change, rule-4 policed.

- **R1 — binding moves.** `let b = a;` transfers; any later use of `a` is a compile error
  naming the move site (note-channel: "moved here"). No clone sites ever fire for
  resources.
- **R2 — overwrite drops.** Assigning onto a binding that still owns a resource drops the
  old value first, then moves the new one in (deterministic; Rust's rule).
  *(Amended 2026-08-07 — B94, ruled and shipped in the v0.34.0 resources-drop lane.)*
  Read the rule over the **place**, not the binding: a write **through a
  writable view** drops the pointee's outgoing value too. A write through a
  view is an in-place mutation of the pointee — that is how it reaches the
  caller at all — so it destroys what it replaces exactly as the owned twin
  does, and the two spellings are indistinguishable by design (the same
  doctrine `capture-clones.md` §6.2/§7.3 applied to captures). The
  implementation had taken the rule literally: `plan_resource_drops` tracks
  bindings the scanned body OWNS, a loan owns nothing, so `self =
  Holder::Empty` inside `&mut self` planned no drop and the scope-end glue then
  read the NEW tag and found nothing — a silent leak, unrelated to width (a
  same-width `Full(g1)` → `Full(g2)` leaked identically).
  - **No liveness question, and none is needed.** The scan's `owned` set exists
    because a body can move its own binding out and must not then drop it
    twice. A loan cannot reach that state: it cannot move the pointee out (R5,
    R6), and a binding its OWNER moved out of is dead, so lending it is R1
    use-after-move — already rejected, and pinned as such. A repeated write
    through one view is safe for a third reason: the glue reads the pointee's
    CURRENT contents, which the previous write already replaced.
  - **The drop precedes the write**, which B89's truncating `__replace` makes
    load-bearing rather than cosmetic: the write sets `target.length =
    value.length` before merging, so a drop emitted after it would destroy
    slots that no longer exist. Pinned in bytes.
  - **The same sentence, read the other way.** A loan owns nothing, so it takes
    no scope-end teardown either. References are transparent (`&mut Holder`
    *is* `Holder`), so `let v = &mut holder` minted a resource-typed local the
    planner enrolled as an owner and the emitted program destroyed the borrowed
    value twice. Fixed here, by the one filter both halves ride.
  *(Amended 2026-08-07 — B99, measured and shipped in the v0.35.0 drop-seams
  lane.)* Read the rule over the **place all the way down**: writing over a
  resource-typed COMPONENT — `slot.held = Holder::Empty`, a tuple element, a
  fixed-array element — destroys the outgoing value too, on an owned place and
  through a view alike. R2 had been spelled over a binding and R5 over reading
  and moving a field, so writing over one fell between them and the value was
  leaked outright.
  - **The predicate is the COMPONENT's own type, asked of the projection and
    not of its root.** That is the whole of the doctrine: `slot.held` and
    `view.held` are the same expression shape and differ only in what the root
    binding is, so an answer that consulted the root would make the two
    spellings distinguishable — the thing B81/B88/B94 exist to forbid. Measured
    against the alternative (§7.2's discipline): restricting to an owned root
    costs the view spelling and buys nothing, and it answers the wrong
    question in both directions — an inferred `List<Guard>` root is not
    classified a resource while a `&mut Slot` root is.
  - **No liveness question, and none is needed** — R5 is the reason, read
    directly. A resource field is loan-only and moving one out of a live
    aggregate is rejected, so a component place always holds a live value; a
    root that was moved out is a use-after-move R1 already rejects; and a
    repeated write is safe because the glue reads the place's CURRENT contents.
    The same three arguments B94 made for the loan, which is why one collector
    (`collect_place_overwrites`) now answers both static halves.
  - **The drop precedes the write**, here for a simpler reason than B94's: the
    drop's operand IS the slot the write replaces, so a drop emitted after it
    would destroy the incoming value. Pinned in bytes both ways — a component
    write is a plain slot assignment and never truncates, and the view path
    keeps its `__replace` ordering pin.
  - **The generic twin is R11's, and is closed there** (B101, below).
- **R3 — parameters.** `self` / `&x` / `&mut x` conventions are loans, unchanged. `own x`
  is a move — and for resources it is *only* a move: where a data `own` argument silently
  copies when not at last use, a resource argument that is not the binding's last use is
  an error.
- **R4 — returns move out.** Including through `if`/`match` tails (a diverging leg is
  exempt as ever).
- **R5 — fields.** A struct literal moves resources in. A resource field is accessed by
  loan only (`self.db.exec(..)`, `&mut self.db`); copying it out is impossible and
  *moving* it out of a live aggregate is rejected (no partial moves in v1). The sanctioned
  partial move is `Option`: `self.slot.take()` (§6).
- **R6 — match consumes.** Matching a resource *by value* consumes the subject; pattern
  captures move the payloads into the arm. (Today's match-capture emission aliases the
  payload — a recorded data-world gap that is exactly move-correct here: the subject is
  dead, the alias is the move.) Matching a loan (`match &self.state`) inspects without
  consuming.
- **R7 — no conditional moves.** A binding must be moved on every path through a scope or
  on none: `let f = open(); if c { consume(f); }` errors ("moved on one path —
  restructure with `Option` + `take`, or move on every path"). This keeps end-of-scope
  ownership static — no runtime drop flags in v1; drop flags are the recorded relaxation
  if real code demands them.
- **R8 — no moves in repeatable interiors.** Moving a binding declared outside a loop from
  inside its body errors (`collect_repeatable_interiors`, the machinery rule 2's elision
  already uses).
- **R9 — closures and spawns cannot capture resources.** The P4c precedent
  (`closure_captures_view_param`) extended from views to resources, spawn closures
  included. The idioms instead: pass a loan down the call graph; make the closure's owner
  a struct that owns the resource; own tasks through an `OwnedNursery` (§9). Injected
  bodies (`context`-clause closures) receive resource *parameters* as loans — parameters
  are per-call, not captures — so `nursery(|n| ..)`-shaped APIs are unaffected.
  *(Amended 2026-07-19 — kolt-migration finding.)* A closure referencing a
  **module-level** resource is exempt: the global is loan-only with process lifetime
  (§5's corollary), so the reference is a per-call loan of storage the closure can
  never own — no second owner is created, and R9's rationale does not apply. The
  checker initially flagged any resource free variable; the walkthrough dodged that
  architecturally (db access in `[rpc]` method bodies), and kolt's storage-agnostic
  hook closures exposed it. Locals and parameters stay rejected.
- **R10 — no resource elements in the native containers.** `List`/`Map`/`Set` (and every
  external generic: `Shared`, `Task`, `Promise`, `Context`) reject resource type
  arguments in v1 — their internals are host code the move checker cannot see. `Option`
  is the sanctioned container (it is a vilan enum, checkable under R11). A move-in/
  view-out `List<R>` API is the recorded v1.5 (connection registries want it eventually).
  Asked **per instantiation** since 2026-08-04 (A19): the check descends a generic
  aggregate's members as instantiated at the written application, so a resource
  reaching a container through a field — `Signal<T>`'s `value: Shared<T>` — is
  rejected too. A member whose type is already concrete is skipped: it is a written
  application in its own right, and would otherwise report twice.
  - **Bycatch, found 2026-08-07 by B99's arc, filed rather than ridden in.** "The
    written application" is load-bearing in the wrong direction: an INFERRED
    `List<Resource>` is never asked. `mut arr: List<Guard> = [Guard { .. }]` is
    rejected as designed, and `mut arr = [Guard { .. }]` — the same program with
    the annotation deleted — compiles, and the element is never destroyed (the
    binding takes no scope-end teardown at all, because a `List` is not a
    resource by containment). Two rules miss it at once, which is why it is its
    own item. The fixed-array spelling `[Guard; 2]` is correct in both halves
    (rejected by nothing, dropped in reverse element order) and is pinned by
    B99's `an_element_write_drops_the_old_value`.
  *(Amended 2026-08-10 — B103, shipped in the v0.36.0 list-resource-escape lane.)*
  **Containment decides whatever the type's PROVENANCE.** The rule now reads "per
  instantiation" with no qualifier: `mut arr = [Guard { .. }]` is refused exactly
  as its annotated twin is, and so is every other route inference takes to the
  same type. The written-application list was never the rule — it was the only
  place the rule had been asked, and the collection seam is the whole root
  cause: `walk_type_node`'s `Node::AccessorWithGenerics` arm recorded a candidate
  per SPELLING, and an inferred type has no spelling. Asking the question of every
  type a value carries closes it.
  - **Which world: ALL-REJECTED.** The second half needed no planner change, and
    that is a finding, not an assumption. R10 admits no route — `Option` (a vilan
    enum, a resource by containment) and the fixed arrays (value aggregates,
    likewise) are the sanctioned resource containers and both already tear down
    correctly. So once (a) rejects every native container at a resource, no
    binding of one can exist for the teardown question to be asked of, and the
    "a `List` is not a resource by containment" half becomes unreachable rather
    than wrong. It stays true, and it stays right: a `List`'s internals are host
    code, so a teardown over them is exactly what the rule refuses to promise.
  - **Two seams, one rule.** The whole-program sweep answers for every type a
    value carries — bindings, parameters, expression types, and the receiver type
    a native method call's substitution writes down when nothing else records it.
    The per-INSTANTIATION seam answers for the half no sweep can reach: `fun
    stash<T>(own value: T) { let items = [value]; }` builds a `List<Guard>` that
    exists only inside the instantiated body, and the caller — `stash(Guard { ..
    })` — never has the type. Asked of the DELTA, per the pass's standing rule
    (B101's phrasing): a container that offends without the substitution is the
    sweep's, with its own span.
  - **Two descent holes closed on the way, both pre-existing and both about
    nesting.** `List<List<Guard>>` holds no resource *argument* — `List<Guard>` is
    not a resource — so the head answered "no", and only the separately-recorded
    inner spelling ever reported; delete the annotation and nothing did. A tuple
    or fixed array had no descent arm at all, so `(1, [Guard { .. }])` was
    invisible. The descent now mirrors `compute_resource`'s in full.
  - **Multiplicity is part of the rule (B5).** A written spelling is a site a
    user can point at, so each still reports. An inferred type is not, and one
    inferred `List<Guard>` reaches the check as the literal, the binding, every
    read of it, and the aggregate holding it — so the inferred tier reports once
    per offending CONTAINER, never for one a spelling already named. `TypeId`
    cannot key that: the analyzer interns per application rather than
    structurally (B95's doctrine), so a binding's type and its own annotation's
    type are different ids for one type. The key is the canonical rendering.
  - **The sweep is clean, and the goldens did not move.** Nothing in std, the
    corpus, the examples or the benchmarks builds a container at a resource —
    R10's annotated form had already fenced the tree — so the widening flips
    nothing, and a rejection emits nothing, so no golden could move. Both
    verified rather than assumed.
- **R11 — generics must be move-clean per instantiation.** Instantiating a type parameter
  with a resource type re-checks the instantiated body under the affine rules (T := the
  resource): every T-typed value used at most once as a move, no captures, no copies.
  `Option::unwrap(self): T` passes (self consumed once, payload moved once); a body that
  reads its parameter twice fails at the instantiation site, not inside std. Mechanism:
  the instance-worklist precedent (async adaptation, platform coloring) — checks keyed by
  (function, resource bindings). Fallback if the general check drags in v1: bless
  `Option`'s surface first and ship the general rule as the follow-up — but the general
  rule is the design.
  *(Amended 2026-08-07 — B101, shipped in the v0.35.0 drop-seams lane.)* The rule
  reaches R2's seam as well as scope ends. **A generic body that OVERWRITES a
  `T`-typed place is rejected at a resource instantiation**: `fun set<T>(slot:
  &mut T, own value: T) { slot = value }` owes the outgoing pointee's drop (R2,
  as B94 amended it) and `fun set<T>(holder: &mut Wrap<T>, own value: T) {
  holder.item = value }` owes the outgoing component's (as B99 amended it), and
  the shared body can emit neither. `check_own_generic_exactly_once`'s
  `place_overwrites` had been deliberately empty with exactly this reason recorded
  in the code; it is filled now, from the same `collect_place_overwrites` the
  whole-program plan uses.
  - **A loan owns nothing, and is not excused either.** That is B94's sentence
    read one layer out: the value a generic body writes over belongs to the
    caller, so it is not this instantiation's to *own* — and somebody must still
    destroy it, which no shared body can.
  - **Asked of the DELTA place set**, per the pass's standing rule: a place whose
    resource-ness is caused by *this* instantiation. A CONCRETE resource
    overwritten inside a generic body is chunk 3's, already correct (the emitted
    body knows the type and B99's drop fires), and re-asking it here would reject
    a correct program once per instantiation site. Plant-proven in both
    directions.
  - **The `own_params.is_empty()` short-circuit is gone.** It was this check's
    original scope surviving as a guard, and it hid *both* widenings from a body
    that takes no `own T`: `fun clear<T>(slot: &mut Option<T>) { slot = None }`
    owes R2's drop and declares none, and B66's scope-end half was equally
    unreachable there (`fun stash<T>(slot: &mut Option<T>) { let taken =
    slot.take(); }` leaked in silence).
  - **The std sweep is clean.** `Option` is the only resource-capable generic
    container (R10 rejects the rest), and its whole surface — `take`, `replace`,
    `unwrap`, `is_some`/`is_none` — plus the `drop` sink instantiates at a
    resource with no report. Pinned as a test rather than left as a claim.
- **R12 — no coercion to `any`.** A resource passed where `any` is expected errors
  (`print(db)` included) — `any` is a data sink; the discipline must not launder away.
  Debug-print fields instead.

## 5. Destruction

- **The trait:**

  ```vilan
  trait Drop {
      fun drop(&mut self);
  }
  ```

  `&mut self`, exactly Rust's shape: the body cleans up through a loan, and the compiler
  destroys the fields *afterward* (reverse field order). This makes resurrection
  impossible — an `own self` destructor could move `self` somewhere that keeps it alive,
  and would need to suppress its own re-drop. Rejected alternative: evolving `Disposable`
  — that is a *cooperative protocol* for data-world teardown (subscriptions, owners; its
  `dispose(self)` is a bare loan, and `Owner.take` stores `|| item.dispose()` closures —
  captures, which R9 forbids for resources). The two coexist: `Disposable` for
  framework-driven data teardown, `Drop` for the language hook. A resource without a
  `Drop` impl is legal — containment alone still enforces moves and drops its fields.

- **Timing and order.** At the owner's scope end, still-owned resource locals drop in
  reverse declaration order; a value's own `drop` body runs before its fields (reverse
  field order); enum payloads drop with the value. Every exit runs drops: fall-through,
  `ret`, `jump break`/`jump continue` (out of the scopes they leave), and panic
  unwinding.
- **Early teardown is a move, not a method:** std gains

  ```vilan
  fun drop<T>(own value: T) {}
  ```

  — moving into `drop(db)` destroys at its (immediate) scope end. No public `close()`
  surfaces to keep in sync with destructors, no double-close states.
- **Module-level resources never drop** (process lifetime; Rust-statics precedent;
  documented — a serve-forever app's `Database` is exactly this). Corollary (stated
  2026-07-19, S4a finding): a module-level resource is **loan-only** — moving it into a
  local binding (or an `own` argument) would hand a process-lifetime resource to a
  droppable owner, closing the shared handle mid-run; rejected ("a module-level
  resource has process lifetime — loan it, never move it").
- **Panic during unwind:** a `drop` that panics while unwinding replaces the in-flight
  error (JS `finally` semantics — documented; a native backend would abort, also
  documented).
- **Across `await`:** owning a resource across a suspension is legal — frames own their
  locals; E3's no-view-across-`await` is about *loans* and is untouched. Under
  cancellation, bridged operations reject (`AbortError`) → the frame unwinds → drops run.
  Honesty limit, same one Part B recorded: an *unbridged*, never-settling await leaks the
  frame and its drops.
- **`drop` is synchronous in v1.** An `async`/awaiting drop body is rejected ("teardown
  must be synchronous — cancel owned tasks via `OwnedNursery`; awaited teardown is a
  future design"). Async-drop is unsolved in Rust for good reasons; not v1's fight.

## 6. `Option.take` — the sanctioned partial move

Moving out of a place must leave a valid value behind. One new intrinsic pair on
`Option<T>` (compiler-known, like the `Shared` intrinsics):

```vilan
impl Option<type T> {
    fun take(&mut self): Option<T>;              // Some(v) -> (None left behind, Some(v) out)
    fun replace(&mut self, value: T): Option<T>; // new in, old out
}
```

Useful for data too (they land as ordinary std surface), but *required* for resources:
`self.conn.take()` is how a field's resource leaves a live aggregate (R5), and
`match opt.take() { Some(let c) => drop(c), None => {} }` is the conditional-teardown
idiom R7 pushes toward.

## 7. JS lowering

- **`try`/`finally` per resource-owning scope.** Only scopes that own resources pay. The
  `finally` drops still-owned locals in reverse order; R7 makes "still-owned" static, so
  there are no runtime flags. `ret`/`jump`/panic all flow through `finally` natively.
- **Drop dispatch** is a direct call to the impl's `drop`, then field drops — emitted as a
  per-type helper (naming/shape decided at implementation). **Every helper needs its
  macro-interpreter arm** (the recorded equivalence-gate gotcha).
- **Moves compile to nothing** (the JS reference passes as it always did); the affine
  rules are purely static. This is the same "checked on JS, meaningful on native"
  single-conformance stance as rule 4.
- **`take`/`replace`** lower like the existing intrinsics (read slot, write slot, return
  old) — the one genuinely new runtime behavior besides `finally`.

## 8. Interactions (each gets a spec sentence)

- **Views / rule 4:** loans are views; E1/E2/E3 apply unchanged. Scope-end drop coincides
  with lexical view death, so no new event kind is needed; a `borrows` projection of a
  resource cannot outlive it (second-class already).
- **Turns / contexts** *(amended 2026-07-19 — S2b implementation finding)*: drops are
  synchronous statements at scope exits. The draft's "a drop that writes signals joins
  the current wave — documented, not special" was wrong about its own lowering: a
  context-requiring `drop` compiles to `drop(self, $ctx)`, and scope-exit insertion
  points neither thread contexts nor statically guarantee one. **v1 rejects a `drop`
  body that requires an ambient context** ("teardown must be context-free — hand
  turn-joining work to an owner inside the turn"); context-threading into teardown is
  recorded future work if a real driver appears. Neither std driver (`Database`,
  `OwnedNursery`) needs it.
- **Platform coloring** *(amended 2026-07-19 — same finding's sibling)*: a drop body
  colors like any function, but the inserted call is transformer-side — reachability
  cannot see it. The mechanism is a **synthetic ownership edge**: a scope owning a
  droppable resource of type `T` reaches `T`'s drop impl in the call graph, so a
  `@process`-needing drop colors its owning scopes.
- **Wire / Hashable / PartialEq derives:** the all-fields checks reject resource fields
  (a resource is not plain data; it cannot be sent, hashed by value, or compared by copy).
- **`const`:** resources are not plain data — const evaluation already rejects them.
- **Contexts:** `Context<R>` is rejected by R10 (context values thread as data). This is
  why `Nursery` — the ambient *handle* — stays data, and ownership lives in a wrapper
  (§9).
- **Macros/worlds:** `resource` is a parse-level modifier; worlds and expansion are
  indifferent.

## 9. Std in v1 — two drivers, and what deliberately does not change

- **`Database`** becomes `resource external struct` with `impl Database with Drop`
  (closing the underlying `node:sqlite` handle). No public `close()` — `drop(db)` is the
  early form. The kolt/server idiom (module-level, process-lifetime) is untouched by
  design (§5).
- **`OwnedNursery`** (name open, (e) in §14) — *the* resource-owner story:

  ```vilan
  resource struct OwnedNursery {
      nursery: Nursery,
  }

  impl OwnedNursery {
      fun new(): OwnedNursery;                                  // __nursery_new, detached
      fun enter<T>(&self, body: (|| T) context ambient_nursery): T;  // spawns inside register here
      fun cancel(&self);                                        // early, idempotent
  }

  impl OwnedNursery with Drop {
      fun drop(&mut self) { self.nursery.cancel(); }
  }
  ```

  `enter` runs its body under `ambient_nursery.run(self.nursery, ..)` — Part B's existing
  registration machinery, minus the join. Drop cancels: in-flight bridged IO aborts.
  Reporting needs **new machinery, not registration as-is**: under shipped semantics a
  nursery-owned child never default-reports (absorption exists for the join to re-raise
  — `task.vl`'s "no `await`, no enclosing nursery" rule), so a never-joining nursery
  would be exactly the silent error sink decision (d) forbids. `enter`'s nursery
  therefore runs in **detached mode**: a child failure that is not a cancellation echo
  takes the free-task reporting path (console, spawn origin) instead of being stored for
  a join, and does not cancel its siblings — children are independent; ownership is
  lifetime, not fate-sharing. Cancellation echoes stay silent. *(Amended 2026-07-19 —
  S4b finding.)* The draft claimed the SSE pump and `Draft.commit` become owned here;
  **they cannot in v1**: their real owners are capture-based (the `Draft` cell lives in
  UI handler closures — R9 forbids a capture-based owner from being a resource) or
  host-lifecycle (connections; `ResponseStream` is this section's own "deliberately
  unchanged" entry). They stay free spawns until **Tier 2's counted closure
  environments** (§10 — capture-with-release is precisely this) or a
  connection-lifetime owner design. Consequently J4's **free-spawn lint** cannot state
  its rule (*a spawn happens inside a `nursery` extent or an `OwnedNursery.enter` —
  anything else is a lint*) without std exceptions yet; it waits with them (backlog
  J4).
- **Deliberately unchanged in v1:** `Shared` (stays a copyable data handle on JS — §10
  owns its counted future), `Owner`/`Disposable`/subscriptions (cooperative data-world
  teardown, framework-driven, capture-based — R9 is exactly why they must not be
  resources), transports (hold `Shared` cells; reconnect semantics want sharing), and
  `ResponseStream` (host-lifecycle via `on_close`).

## 10. Tier 2 — the counted class (specified now, built with the native arc)

- **`Shared<T>` becomes a counted resource**: `clone()` = retain; a handle's death =
  release; zero → the cell's value drops. Handle death is deterministic *because handles
  ride the Tier-1 machinery* (scope-end, moves) — the counting itself is what JS never
  needed and native requires (F3's "ARC for `Shared`"). An optional JS *counted mode*
  (debug builds) is recorded as a verification tool, not a semantic.
- **The dynamic trap law matches static rule 4** (from `claims-and-epochs.md` §5b —
  rev-1's "a `write()` while any other view is live traps" is *stricter* than the static
  rule it claims to mirror, and the asymmetry must not fossilize into the native tier):
  statics deliberately permit aliased views and content writes (two `&mut` to one
  scalar; sibling-field writes under a field view) and forbid only *invalidation*. The
  dynamic check enforces the same event set: a cell-value reassignment,
  geometry-bumping operation, or death under another live view into the cell traps;
  overlapping content writes never do. C2's runtime generations key off the same
  events, and C6's inferred geometry effects (`bumps`, the twin of `borrows`) are what
  classify a method call through `write()` — one law, one event classifier, two
  checkers.
- **`Weak<T>` (C1)**: `Shared::downgrade(&self): Weak<T>`; `Weak.upgrade(): Option<Shared<T>>`
  — `Some` (retaining) while strong > 0, `None` after, *deterministically*. Ships with
  counting; the 2026-07-07 rejection of GC-timing `WeakRef` stands. **Also
  `Weak.get(&self): Option<&T> borrows self`** (from `claims-and-epochs.md` §5a): the
  scoped, non-retaining twin of `upgrade`, mirroring `Arena.get`'s specified form
  (backlog C8 migrates std's interim copy-returning `get` to it) — every dynamic alias
  then answers the same verb with the same `Option<&T>` shape. The view is second-class and
  rule-4-policed; on native it pins the cell for its lexical extent (a scoped
  retain/release pair — a last-strong release inside that extent defers the cell's drop
  to the view's block end: deterministic, merely later), on JS it is a plain read.
  `upgrade` is for keeping the cell alive; `get` is for touching it. This also delivers
  the second store rev-1's deferred `Store<T>` trait was waiting for (`Shared`/`Weak`
  is a one-slot counted arena: `clone` = retain, `Weak` = the handle) — extract the
  trait when Tier 2 builds, not before.
- **Counted closure environments**: a closure capturing a counted handle holds a retain,
  released when the environment dies — which requires environments themselves to be
  counted objects (Swift's model). This is the single reason `Shared` cannot join Tier 1:
  capture is its job (subscriber lists, turn queues), and R9 would gut it. Nothing in
  Tier 1 assumes closure environments are free, so the door stays open.
- **C2's dynamic rule-4** (cross-handle generation checks) rides the same native lowering,
  per `backlog-2026-07-18.md`.

## 11. Diagnostics vocabulary (the standard applies)

- Use-after-move: primary at the use, note at the move ("`db` was moved here — a resource
  has one owner; loan it with `&db` / `&mut db`, or restructure with `Option` + `take`").
- Capture: "a closure cannot capture the resource `db` — pass a loan into the call, or
  give ownership to the struct that owns this closure's lifetime".
- Conditional move (R7), loop move (R8), container element (R10), unclean generic (R11,
  spanned at the instantiation), `any` coercion (R12), `Drop` on data, non-last-use `own`
  argument — each with a steer.

## 12. Implementation plan (slices, each suite-gated, docs in the same commit)

1. **S1 — classification + the affine checker** (no destructors yet): `resource` modifier
   through lexer/parser/formatter/analyzer; containment inference; R1–R12 checks; the
   full pin matrix (below). Pure validation — corpus byte-identical.
2. **S2 — `Drop` + insertion + lowering**: the trait, scope-end `finally` emission,
   overwrite-drop, ordering; macro-interpreter arms; corpus `resource.vl`.
3. **S3 — `Option.take`/`replace` intrinsics + match-move rules + std `drop<T>(own)`**.
4. **S4 — std adoption**: `Database` + `OwnedNursery` (+ e2e: dropping an owner cancels
   an in-flight sleeping task — the cancellation.rs shape); the J4 free-spawn lint if the
   rule states cleanly.
5. **S5 — spec §6.x "Resources and destruction" + tour chapter + errors appendix.** Also
   re-words spec §6.4's implementation note and §6.7's "exclusive" parenthetical to the
   reconciled trap law (§10 — trap on invalidation, not on overlap), and — per the
   ratified §8(c) of `claims-and-epochs.md` — opens the memory chapter with the
   claims/epochs law.

## 13. Pin matrix (S1/S2 acceptance)

{let-move, mut-overwrite-drops, own-param-move, own-not-last-use-error, loans via
`self`/`&`/`&mut`, return-move, struct-literal-move, field-loan-only, enum-payload,
match-consume, match-loan-inspects, `take`/`replace`, conditional-move reject,
loop-interior reject, closure-capture reject, spawn-capture reject, injected-body loan
accept, container-element reject, `Context<R>` reject, generic move-clean accept
(`Option::unwrap`, `map`-shape), generic dirty reject, `any` reject, `Drop`-on-data
reject, drop order (locals reverse; fields reverse; body-before-fields), early `ret` /
`jump` drops, panic-unwind drops, across-`await` ownership, cancellation-runs-drops
(e2e), module-level-never-drops, resource-without-Drop (containment-only) drops fields}
— each its own pin, per the per-case testing rule.

## 14. Open questions — user calls wanted before S1

> **All calls made 2026-07-18** — recommendations ratified as written. (e), which
> carried no recommendation: the draft's working name **`OwnedNursery`** stands; the
> rename window closes when S4 ships it. Items kept below for the record.

- **(a) Spelling**: `resource` as a prefix modifier (`resource struct`, `resource external
  struct`) — or another word (`owned`?). Recommendation: `resource`.
- **(b) Naming**: trait `Drop { fun drop(&mut self) }` + std `drop<T>(own value)`.
  Recommendation: as written (short, unambiguous, precedented; `Disposable` stays for the
  data-world protocol).
- **(c) R7 strictness**: reject conditional moves in v1 (recommendation) vs runtime drop
  flags from day one.
- **(d) Owned-nursery children reporting**: keep free-task failure reports (recommendation)
  vs silent absorption after the owner drops.
- **(e) `OwnedNursery` naming** — `OwnedNursery` / `TaskOwner` / `Tasks` / other.
- **(f) R10 for v1**: `Option`-only containment (recommendation), `List<R>` API recorded
  as v1.5.
- **(g) Tier 2 wholly deferred to the native arc** (recommendation) — including `Weak`,
  whose C1 blocker refines from "C4" to "counting".
- **(h) The two Tier-2 clarifications from `claims-and-epochs.md`** — `Weak.get` and the
  trap-law reconciliation (§10). Recommendation: ratify with this proposal; both are
  spec-only until the native arc builds them. (`claims-and-epochs.md` §8 carries its own
  three decisions — the closure rule itself, C7 wire handles, and where the frame lives.)
