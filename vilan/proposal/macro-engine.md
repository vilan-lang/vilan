# The macro engine (roadmap #9)

Status: **COMPLETE — every scheduled phase SHIPPED as of 2026-07-07.** Phases
0–3 (interpreter, attributes, invocations, migration of all five derives +
`[service]`), module-scoped names with `derives.vl` dissolved, the `[macro]`
budget knob, editor support, the construction API steps 1–2 (`Arguments`
accessors + `macro_std::build`), the ambient meta prelude, and Phase 4
`macro { .. }` blocks. Tree interchange (construction step 3) was
measurement-gated and is **not taken** — the measured verdict is recorded in
§3. What remains is the explicitly-beyond-v1 tail at the end of §11 (semantic
queries, quasi-quotation, the compiled macro host, on-disk caching), each
recorded with its trigger. The strategic frontier this document opened:
user-land vilan code that runs *inside the compiler* and generates vilan code.
It subsumed the built-in derives and `[service]` generation — the hand-rolled,
Rust-side special cases — and unlocks the uses they cannot serve
(numeric-type families, custom derives, embedded-DSL checking).

## 1. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**

- **User-land vilan interacts with the compiler** (the defining property): a macro is
  ordinary vilan source, in the user's package or a library, that the compiler runs at
  compile time against a *reflection of the program* and whose output becomes part of
  the program.
- **Two primary uses**, and the design is shaped around exactly these:
  1. **Custom attributes** — `[my_attr(..)]` on an item transforms or augments it
     (custom derives are the flagship: `[derive(Builder)]`, `[derive(Display)]`).
  2. **Repetitious code generation** — item- and expression-position invocations that
     stamp out families of code (`macro numeric_types(i8, i16, i64)`,
     `macro lut(256, |i| ..)`).
- **Isolation**: macros live in their own scope — their code cannot touch runtime
  bindings, runtime code cannot call macros, and macro execution cannot observe
  anything but its declared inputs (no I/O, no ambient state — §4).
- **Subsumption**: the built-in derives (`PartialEq`/`Default`/`Debug`/`Json`/`Wire`)
  and the `[service(Client)]` generator become expressible as macros, and are migrated
  only behind a byte-identical corpus gate (§10).

**Non-goals (v1)**

- **Semantic queries.** A v1 macro sees *syntax* — the item's structure as data — not
  resolved types. Every shipped generator already lives within this limit (the derive
  checks are deliberately recursive-syntactic; see `analyzer-stabilization`'s record of
  why). Type-aware macros need expansion staged *after* inference, a far bigger design;
  recorded in §11.
- **Token-level `macro_rules` pattern matching.** Macros are functions over reflected
  items, not rewrite rules — one model, not two.
- **Hygiene beyond gensym.** §7 defines the v1 rule; full hygienic renaming is future.

## 2. The two uses, concretely

**A custom derive** (attribute use). Today `Debug` is ~30 lines of Rust `format!` in
`analyzer.rs`; as a macro it is vilan in userland:

```vilan
// In any module — a macro fun's body is hermetic (§3): it sees only what it
// imports, and it imports only from `macro_std`.
macro fun derive_display(item: Item): Source {
	import macro_std::source;
	import macro_std::display::format;

	let target = item.as_struct()!;
	mut arms: List<str> = [];
	for field in target.fields {
		arms.push(i"\"{field.name}=\" + format(self.{field.name})");
	}
	source(i"""
		impl {target.name} with Display \{
			fun to_string(self): str \{ {arms.join(" + \", \" + ")} \}
		\}
		""")
}
```
```vilan
[derive(Display)]            // dispatches to the registered macro
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }
```

**Repetitious generation** (invocation use). The `macro` keyword prefixes every
compile-time construct — definitions, invocations, and blocks — the same way
`async`/`await` mark vilan's other evaluation-mode shifts:

```vilan
macro numeric_family(i8, i16, i64)     // item position: expands to N struct+impl sets

fun area(): i32 {
	macro unroll(4, |i| accumulate(i))  // expression position: 4 inlined calls
}
```

Item macros receive their arguments as syntax and return items; expression macros
return an expression. Attributes receive *the item they annotate* plus their arguments.
One keyword makes the compile-time boundary greppable: `macro` finds every place code
runs at expansion time.

**The two attribute forms are both permanent, for different jobs.** `[name(args)]`
is the general attribute: one macro, on any item, with arguments. `[derive(A, B, C)]`
is the batching form for the "add impls" pattern: a LIST, mixing built-in derives and
user macros in one site (`[derive(PartialEq, Json, Display)]` — the first two Rust
generators until Phase 3 migrates them, the third user-land), taking no arguments.
It is also the migration seam: built-ins become macros behind this same syntax with
byte-identical output. In v1 both forms are purely ADDITIVE (the annotated item
always compiles unchanged; the macro's output is appended) — the forms diverge when
item *transformation* lands: an attribute may then rewrite its item, a derive never
will. Naming convention: a derive-style macro is named after the trait it implements
(`macro fun Display(..)` → `[derive(Display)]`); an attribute-style macro gets a
verb-ish name (`[route("/api")]`). Whether a derive's registered name should be
decoupled from its function name (a `proc_macro_derive`-style registration) is a
Phase 3 question — it becomes concrete when the built-ins migrate.

The prefix marks **boundary crossings only** (settled in review): a `macro name(..)`
splice site sits in *program* code, so it needs the keyword. Inside the macro world a
`macro fun` calling another `macro fun` is an ordinary call — no prefix, no ambiguity
(runtime functions are invisible there, §3), and composing macros is just calling
functions and concatenating their `Source`.

## 3. The model: staged compilation, syntax in → source out

A macro is a `macro fun` — the `macro` modifier on an ordinary function definition
(reusing the whole `fun` grammar: parameters, generics, helpers), whose parameter and
return types come from the compiler's reflection vocabulary (`std::meta`):

```vilan
macro fun name(item: Item, arguments: Arguments): Source { .. }
```

After `macro`, the parser decides on one token: `fun` → a definition, `{` → a
compile-time block (Phase 4), an identifier → an invocation. `macro` becomes a
reserved word. Other `macro <item>` forms (`macro struct`, …) are reserved errors in
v1 ("only functions can be macros").

- **`std::meta`** (new, the compiler-interaction surface): `Item` (an enum over
  `StructItem`/`EnumItem`/`FunctionItem`/…), `Field { name: str, type_: TypeExpr }`,
  `TypeExpr` (a *syntactic* type: name + arguments, renderable), `Arguments` (the
  invocation's argument syntax), and `Source` (generated code). These are ordinary
  vilan structs — the compiler constructs them from its AST and consumes `Source` back.
- **Output is source text** (`source(str)` builds a `Source`). This is the proven
  in-house shape: every derive and the service generator emit source strings today, and
  text is what makes caching sound (§6). Quasi-quotation sugar can come later without
  changing the model; `i"…"` interpolation already carries the pattern well. The
  recorded evolution beyond text is a formal construction API — see below.

### From text to a construction API (recorded direction, 2026-07-06)

Text output is the right v1 (§5/§6), but the first real macros surfaced its costs:
brace/quote escaping makes templates noisy; ill-formed output is a runtime-of-expansion
failure ("generated invalid vilan") where an API could make it unrepresentable; and
macro ARGUMENTS arrive as raw source text — the shipped `unroll` macro parses its own
integer argument out of a string. The evolution, in adoption order:

1. **Input accessors (first — small, immediate DX).** `Arguments` gains typed views
   over the existing syntactic capture: `as_i32(index)`, `as_str_literal(index)`,
   `as_identifier(index)`, arity — no more `parse_i32` on your own arguments. Later,
   full `meta::Expr` reflection for arguments (kind + children + rendered text), so
   `unroll(4, |i| ..)` receives a real integer and a real closure expression.
2. **Output builders (macro_std sugar — no compiler change)** — **SHIPPED
   2026-07-07** as `macro_std::build`: ordinary vilan that RENDERS TO TEXT
   internally. The parser stays the single grammar authority (the §5 lesson — no
   dual lowering), `Source` and the §6 text cache are untouched, and `source(str)`
   remains the escape hatch for shapes the builders don't cover yet. This captures the
   DX win: no escapes, structured composition, the common shapes (an impl of N
   methods, a match over an enum's variants) as combinators. The shipped shape:
   `quote`/`join`/`indent` text helpers plus `impl_of`/`fun_of`/`match_of`/
   `struct_of`/`init_of` builders that chain by value and render depth-0 text,
   containers re-indenting child text line-by-line — nesting works by rendering
   the inner shape into the outer one. Every std derive and `[service]` is
   written against them, byte-identically.
3. **Tree interchange (last — compiler-visible, decide from measurements)** —
   **measured 2026-07-07: NOT TAKEN.** The idea: a `Source` variant carrying
   reflected AST values the compiler converts directly to nodes, skipping
   lex+parse of the output; the costs it would have to pay first: a value→node
   converter held to `for_each_child`'s exhaustiveness discipline, spans for
   constructed nodes, and caching the tree's canonical rendering. The
   measurement (release build, first compile, parse-of-generated-text share of
   total wall): the **rpc example** — the heaviest real macro consumer,
   `[service]` + `Wire`/`Json` — spends **0.8%** (15ms of 1.9s, 7.7KB
   generated); a **synthetic stress** of 60 structs × 4 derives (240
   expansions, 66KB generated) spends **39%** of a 188ms build. Two facts
   defuse the stress number: it is FIRST-compile cost only (the §6 expansion
   cache and the content-addressed parse cache erase it on every re-analysis,
   which is the LSP's whole workload), and it is per-parse overhead (~0.3ms ×
   240 invocations), not text volume — so if a derive-heavy first compile ever
   matters, BATCHING the per-expansion parses captures most of the win with no
   model change. Tree interchange is re-opened only if a real workload hurts
   after batching.
- **The macro world is HERMETIC, per function** (settled in review — one rule solving
  the prelude gate and the helper ambiguity at once): a `macro fun`'s body sees
  **nothing** of its surrounding module — not its imports, not its functions, not its
  module-level `let`s. What a macro body can reference is exactly: its own parameters
  and locals, **other `macro fun`s** (its helpers — inside the macro world, calling one
  is an ordinary call; the `macro name(..)` syntax is for *splice sites* in program
  code), the language intrinsics (literals, `List`/`str` built-ins), **the ambient
  meta vocabulary** (shipped 2026-07-07: the `meta` reflection types plus
  `source`/`fresh` are in scope with no imports — the compiler-interaction surface is
  ambient the way the derive macros are ambient in program code; an explicit same-name
  definition shadows it), and whatever it imports **inside its own scope** — and
  macro-scope imports resolve against exactly one package: **`macro_std`**. Libraries
  (`option`, `build`, …) stay explicit imports: the ambient set is exactly the surface
  a macro exists to talk to, nothing more.
- **`macro_std`** is the macro world's std — a separate, toolchain-shipped package,
  *not* a filtered view of `std`: `macro_std::meta` (the reflection types),
  `macro_std::source`, and re-exports of the pure core (`option`, `result`, `list`,
  `map`, `display`, …) so macros keep the ordinary vocabulary. There is nothing to
  subset or police: if it isn't in `macro_std`, a macro can't name it. No `fs`, no
  clock, no `[extern]` — the package simply doesn't contain them. Scoped `import` is
  **not macro-special grammar**: it is the general block-scoped-imports feature
  (**shipped 2026-07-05**; backlog H2 — imports legal in any block, binding like a
  `let`), which macro bodies consume with one restriction: their imports resolve against the
  `macro_std` universe instead of the package universe. Same grammar everywhere; the
  hermetic rule is purely a resolution restriction.
- **Two orthogonal systems, cleanly split:** macro *names* distribute through the
  ordinary module system (a module exports its `macro fun`s; `import pkg::x::my_macro`
  brings the macro into scope for `[derive(..)]`/`macro my_macro(..)` sites), while
  macro *bodies* live in the hermetic world. A macro can therefore sit in the same
  file as the runtime code it serves — there are no "macro modules", no marker, and
  no module partitioning; the `macro fun` head is the entire boundary, at exactly the
  granularity the boundary is real.
- **Staging falls out per-function**: the macro world (`macro fun`s + `macro_std`)
  is closed under its own references, so it compiles first by construction — no
  module-graph cut. Macros generating `macro fun`s are rejected in v1 (no fixpoint of
  worlds).
- **Expansion is a pre-analysis pass**, exactly where `expand_derives` sits today:
  after parse, before the walk — iterated to a fixpoint over *item* expansions (a
  macro's output may carry attribute invocations), with a depth cap (default 16) whose
  overflow is a clean "macro expansion did not settle" error naming the chain.

**The recorded cost of hermeticity:** logic needed by BOTH worlds exists twice (or the
macro *emits* it — generated code freely calls runtime libraries; the macro body
cannot). Shared constants between a macro and the runtime code beside it are likewise
duplicated. This is the deliberate trade against Zig-style dual-use functions
(bi-modal checking per function, an interpreter covering everything macro-reachable);
revisitable if it bites in practice.

## 4. Isolation — the macro's own scope

The user requirement, made mechanical:

- **A separate namespace.** `macro fun`s are not values: they cannot be assigned,
  passed, or called by runtime code (`name(..)` finds no function; the error suggests
  `macro name(..)`). Symmetrically, runtime items are invisible to macro bodies — the
  hermetic rule (§3): a macro body resolves names against its locals, other
  `macro fun`s, intrinsics, and its own `macro_std` imports, nothing else.
- **`macro_std` is the entire reachable library surface** (§3): isolation needs no
  enforcement pass, because the sandbox is the package boundary itself — `fs`, the
  clock, `random`, `process`, and `[extern]` aren't restricted, they are *absent*.
- **Consequence: determinism by construction.** A macro's output is a pure function of
  (its own source, its inputs). No clock, no randomness, no filesystem, no environment.
  This is not just safety hygiene — it is what makes caching (§6) *correct* rather than
  heuristic, the same reasoning that bans `Date.now`/`Math.random` in workflow scripts.

## 5. Execution: interpreted vs compiled — the decision

The compiler is Rust; macros are vilan. Three ways to run them:

| | **(a) Tree-walking interpreter** (in `vilan-core`) | (b) Compile to JS, run in a node host | (c) Native plugin objects |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup cost | ~0 | node spawn ~30–80 ms, or a persistent daemon | build step per macro crate |
| Throughput | ~10–100× slower than JS per op | full JS speed | full native speed |
| Sandboxing | **total** — the interpreter simply has no I/O ops | must sandbox node (fs/net reachable; `--experimental-permission` or a frozen realm — real attack surface) | none (arbitrary code) |
| Determinism | enforced by construction | enforced only by discipline/sandbox | no |
| LSP fit (runs per keystroke) | excellent | poor without a daemon; daemon = lifecycle complexity | poor |
| Implementation | a new, but small, eval over the existing typed AST for the prelude subset | reuses the whole backend; IPC protocol needed | contradicts "user-land vilan" |

**Recommendation: (a), an interpreter — with fuel.** The deciding arguments:

1. **The workload is small.** Macros process item syntax and build strings — hundreds
   to low-thousands of operations per item. At even 100× JS slowness that is
   microseconds-to-milliseconds per item, far inside the LSP's ~200 ms debounce budget.
   Macros are not where programs compute; a macro that *is* compute-heavy is the
   pathology fuel exists for.
2. **Sandboxing and determinism come free**, and §6's caching *depends* on determinism.
   Option (b) spends its speed winnings buying back, imperfectly, what (a) has by
   construction.
3. **Fuel bounds the failure mode**: each expansion gets an instruction budget
   (default: 1M steps; configurable per package in `vilan.toml [macro]`). Exhaustion
   is a clean spanned error naming the macro — the same pattern as the reactive flush
   budget. An infinite loop in a macro can never hang the compiler or the editor.
4. **The escape hatch is additive.** If a real macro workload outgrows the interpreter,
   a persistent compile-to-JS macro host (b, daemonized) can be added *behind the same
   `std::meta` contract* — the macro's source doesn't change, only the engine. Decide
   that from measurements, not in advance.

The interpreter's scope is `macro_std` plus the intrinsics (no async, no views/arenas —
value semantics over plain data), which keeps it small and testable: its conformance
suite is "every prelude corpus program the subset admits produces the same output
interpreted as compiled" — an executable equivalence gate.

### What the interpreter executes: the transformer's own JS AST (Phase 0 decision)

The "eval over the existing typed AST" above sharpened during implementation into
something strictly better: the interpreter evaluates **`js::Node` — the transformer's
output AST** — not the analyzed vilan IR. The macro world compiles through the
ordinary full pipeline (analyze → contexts → transform); the interpreter picks up
where the JS *formatter* otherwise would.

1. **One lowering, not two.** Generic dispatch, monomorphization, value-semantics
   copies, and match compilation live in the transformer — the exact subsystems the
   solver-stabilization arc hardened. A vilan-IR interpreter would be a second
   implementation of the hardest logic in the compiler, diverging precisely where
   bugs are subtlest. Over `js::Node`, the interpreter cannot disagree with codegen
   about what a program *means*.
2. **Equivalence by construction.** Compiled and interpreted paths share everything
   down to the last AST; the residual claim is only "this evaluator matches a JS
   engine on the emitted subset", which the conformance suite tests *directly* —
   run node, run the interpreter, diff the output.
3. **Future features are free.** Whatever the transformer learns to emit, macros can
   run — no interpreter work per language feature.
4. **The emitted subset is tiny and closed.** ~25 node kinds; values are
   undefined/null/bool/number/BigInt/string/array/`Set`/`Map`/closure plus the one
   `{ v }` cell `Shared` uses — no general objects (structs are positional arrays),
   no classes, no prototypes, no `this`. The dynamic semantics to match are JS's
   arithmetic, `===`, string `+`, UTF-16 string indexing, and insertion-ordered
   `Set`/`Map`.
5. **Runtime helpers are native.** The `__` helpers the backend injects as source
   text are implemented in Rust, mirroring their JS sources one-to-one; the impure
   ones (`__scan`/`__env`/`__args`/`__random_*`) and `[extern]` host imports are
   clean "not available at expansion time" errors — the sandbox stays a *missing
   capability*, not a check.
6. **Fuel** decrements per node evaluated; a call-depth cap bounds recursion. Both
   exhaust into clean errors naming the macro.

## 6. Caching — both sides of the problem, addressed

Macros run on every analysis, and the LSP analyzes on every debounced keystroke. Naive
re-expansion is O(macros × items) per keystroke; caching is mandatory. Both directions
have real problems — stated first, then the design.

**The cached-input problem.** A cache key must cover *everything the expansion read*.
If macros could read arbitrary compiler state (types, other modules, the filesystem),
the key becomes an open-ended read-log: under-key it and you serve **stale expansions —
a miscompile**, the worst outcome available; over-key it (hash the world) and nothing
ever hits. This is why §4's isolation is a caching decision as much as a safety one:
v1 shrinks the legal input surface to exactly **(macro definition, invocation input)**
— nothing else is readable, so nothing else needs keying.

**The cached-output problem.** An expansion's *analyzed* form is full of per-analysis
state: entity ids and type ids come from global counters, spans index into leaked
buffers, scopes are rebuilt each run (this is precisely the known incremental-analysis
blocker, roadmap #12). Caching analyzed output across analyses would require id/span
remapping — a project in itself. Caching *within* one analysis has a subtler trap:
expression macros run per site, and two sites with identical input may still need
distinct gensyms (§7), so even intra-run memoization must key the gensym seed.

**The design — cache text, never trees:**

1. **The unit of caching is the expansion's SOURCE TEXT** — id-free, span-free,
   analysis-independent. Key: `hash(the macro's REACHABLE definition set — its own
   source plus the macro funs it transitively calls) × hash(invocation input source) ×
   engine/macro_std version`. The reachable set is well-defined because the macro
   world is closed (§3); the hashes are cheap and have in-house precedent
   (`load_package_module`'s content-addressed parse cache). Determinism (§4) is what
   makes this *sound*: same key ⇒ same text, always.
2. **The parse of cached text rides the existing parse cache** (content-addressed, so
   a hit costs a hash lookup), and the walk re-runs per analysis — exactly how std
   modules already work per keystroke. Fresh ids/spans every run; no remapping problem.
3. **Granularity: per-invocation** (which subsumes "module-level" — a module's
   expansions are its invocations' entries). Item attributes key on the annotated
   item's source; expression macros key on their argument source. An edit anywhere in
   a module invalidates *only* the invocations whose own input text changed — a
   keystroke inside a function body re-expands nothing item-level at all.
4. **Expression-level caching gets one extra ingredient:** the gensym counter (§7) is
   part of the *output* contract, so cached text is stored with **placeholder gensyms**
   (`__m0`, `__m1`, …) and stamped per site at splice time (a string substitution, not
   a re-run). This is the honest resolution of "cached output is problematic" at
   expression granularity: the only per-site variance is names, so names are the only
   thing re-materialized.
5. **The cache is in-memory per process** (compiler run / LSP session), bounded LRU.
   An on-disk cache is a later, optional layer with the same key — safe because the
   key already covers everything.

What this deliberately does **not** attempt: caching across *semantic* context (there
is none to read, §1 non-goals), and caching analyzed IR (blocked on the same counters
as incremental analysis; if roadmap #12 ever lands stable ids, revisit).

## 7. Hygiene and generated names

- Expanded code resolves **in the expansion site's scope** — like today's derives; a
  derive-style macro *wants* to see the item's module (imports included). The known
  sharp edge (the derive prelude's duplicate-import collision we hit in P6) becomes a
  rule: generated imports must be idempotent — the engine dedups exact-duplicate
  `import` lines in spliced output.
- **`fresh(): str`** is the gensym (ambient in macro bodies): names that cannot
  collide with user code or other expansions (reserved `__m` namespace, per-site
  stamped — §6.4). Shipped without the once-sketched `prefix` parameter — a prefix
  variant comes with its first consumer. v1 hygiene = "use `fresh` for anything you
  bind"; full auto-renaming is future work.
- A macro's *helpers* (other `macro fun`s) are invisible to the program world —
  generated code cannot call them; anything the output needs must be emitted or be
  ordinary library code the *program* imports.

## 8. Errors, spans, and the LSP

- **A macro failure is a compile error at the invocation site**: panics (converted —
  the interpreter catches its own traps), fuel exhaustion, and `Source` that fails to
  parse ("macro `X` generated invalid vilan: line N …" — the module-parse-error
  machinery, which already reports loudly with file+line, extended with the macro's
  name and the offending generated text attached).
- **Spans inside expansions** ride the existing `DERIVED_SOURCE` mechanism: entities
  from generated text are marked, editor features skip them, and diagnostics in
  generated code anchor at the invocation with the "(in generated code)" label — all
  shipped behavior (E1), inherited unchanged.
- The LSP re-expands per analysis through the §6 cache; a macro edit invalidates by
  definition-set hash, so editing a `macro fun` live-updates its expansions on the
  next debounce. Inside a macro body, completion/hover resolve against the hermetic
  scope (`macro_std` + macro funs) — the same platform-gating shape the LSP already
  applies per target.

## 9. Pipeline integration

```
load + parse
  → macro world compiles (macro funs + macro_std; closed, so no ordering analysis)
  → EXPAND (fixpoint over item invocations, depth ≤ 16, per-invocation cache)
  → walk → build → contexts → async → transform     (unchanged)
```

Expression-position invocations expand during the same pass (they are syntax → syntax;
the walk never sees a `macro` invocation). The corpus stays byte-identical through the engine's landing
because nothing uses it until a program opts in — the same additive discipline as
variadic generics.

## 10. Migration — subsuming the special cases

The prize is deleting Rust: `derive_impl_source` (~500 lines) and `service_impl_source`
(~250 lines) become vilan macros in std. The gate is absolute: each built-in migrates
only when its macro produces **byte-identical generated source** for the whole corpus +
examples (the goldens are the referee). `derive(..)` dispatch: built-in names resolve
to std macros once migrated; unknown names resolve to user macros in scope; a miss
keeps today's behavior (skip; the missing-impl error surfaces at the use site).

**How the std macros are used: they aren't imported — they're the PRELUDE**
(realized 2026-07-06; the interim `derives.vl` special file is dissolved). Each
derive macro lives in its trait's own std module — `PartialEq` in `compare.vl`,
`Default` in `default.vl`, `Debug` in `debug.vl`, `Json` AND `Wire` (plus their
shared text-builder helpers, which are file-scoped) in `json.vl`, `service` in
`rpc.vl` — and **macros defined in std modules are ambient**: `[derive(PartialEq)]`
works with zero imports because the derive-hosting modules are always loaded
(`compare`/`default`/`debug`/`json` joined the core-load set; `rpc` is too heavy to
always-load, so a `[service]` item anywhere seeds it). USER macros are
module-scoped: in scope in their defining file, and elsewhere via a LEAF import
(`import pkg::x::my_macro`, any depth per H2) — a bare module import does not
suffice. Same-file macros shadow imports, which shadow the prelude; a user macro
may shadow a prelude derive for its own file (the old reserved-names rule is
subsumed by scoping). Macro NAMES also bind as first-class markers in the analyzer
(imports/`use`/go-to-definition resolve them; using one as a value is a clean
error), yielding to same-named ITEMS — a derive macro deliberately shares its
trait's name in the trait's own module, and the item import keeps meaning the
trait. Macro worlds compile LAZILY at first dispatch (registration is syntactic),
cached process-globally by blanked content; world errors attribute to the DEFINING
file. Generated code carries its own imports (each macro's output starts with the
trait imports it needs — the Rust-side prelude synthesizer is gone).

**Amendment (2026-07-06), on "the native path is deleted in the same commit":** the
Rust generators for migrated derives are NOT dead code and stay. Two consumers remain:
(1) test fixtures with custom `std` trees have no `derives.vl`, and (2) compiling
`derives.vl`'s own macro world re-enters the builtin lookup — the recursion guard
serves it an empty registry, so any derive used by std modules inside that world takes
the Rust path. Both produce byte-identical output by the gate, so the fallback is a
second copy of a FROZEN contract, not a second live implementation; it shrinks to
deletion only if fixtures gain a derives.vl and the world bootstraps differently.
Actual migration order (2026-07-06): `PartialEq` → `Default` → `Debug`, with
`Json`/`Wire` → `[service]` remaining (the stress test — cross-module, contract
hashing, mirror lets).

## 11. Phased plan

- **Phase 0 — `macro_std` + the interpreter core** — **SHIPPED 2026-07-06.** The
  interpreter (`crates/vilan-core/src/interpreter.rs`) evaluates the transformer's
  `js::Node` AST (the §5 decision) behind `transform_to_ast` with fuel + a call-depth
  cap; the equivalence gate (`tests/interpreter.rs`) runs EVERY admitted corpus
  program both ways — node vs interpreter — and compares (stdout, exit code) exactly:
  70/70 equivalent, 3 exclusions (async ×2, host env ×1), ~4s. Failure modes pinned:
  fuel exhaustion, depth cap, impure capability (`Unsupported`, "not available at
  expansion time"), panic (`Thrown`). `vilan/macro_std` ships `meta` (Item/StructItem/
  EnumItem/FunctionItem/Field/TypeExpr.render/Variant/Arguments/Source) + `source()`,
  pinned end-to-end via a consumer app (`crates/vilan-cli/tests/macro_std.rs`).
  Recorded v1 bounds (each a loud error, never silent): BigInt beyond i128, async,
  the unimplemented host-method tail.
- **Phase 1 — attributes** — **SHIPPED 2026-07-06.** `macro fun` items parse
  (`macro` is reserved; only `fun` may follow in v1) and never walk in the program
  world; each file's macros compile in a per-file hermetic world — the file with
  everything outside the definitions BLANKED to whitespace (spans stay true), the
  `macro` keyword erased, analyzed against a workspace whose only dependency is
  `macro_std` (body imports checked to root there; H2's block-scoped imports carry
  the signatures too, since a `fun`'s scope is flat). `transform_functions` emits the
  world rooted at the macro funs (no `main`); `run_entry` executes one against the
  reflected `Item` (+ `Arguments` for two-parameter macros: the argument SOURCE
  TEXTS) and returns the `Source` text, which parses loudly and splices — the
  generated code walks into the invoking module's scope and may carry its own
  block-scoped imports (no synthesized prelude), with `[derive(..)]`s in output
  expanded and further attributes chased to depth 16. `[derive(Name)]` dispatches to
  the macro NAMED `Name`; built-ins keep their generators; unknown attributes error.
  Worlds cache by blanked-content hash, expansions by (world, macro, item text,
  argument texts) — both process-global. `macro_std` now re-exports the pure core
  (`option`/`result`/`display`/`debug`/`compare`/`operators`/`map`/`set` + `panic`,
  the error channel: a throw = a spanned "failed at expansion time" at the site).
  Exit criterion met: a library-defined macro drives generation in its consuming app
  (CLI-pinned), plus the §2 corpus program (`macro-derive.vl`) and 12 inference pins
  (dispatch both forms, arguments, output-derives fixpoint, hermetic violation,
  unknown name, duplicate names, panic/fuel/invalid-output/macro-generating-macro,
  body-position rejection).
  **Recorded v1 bounds:** macro names are a flat global namespace (module-scoped
  distribution = follow-up); attributes expand at file top level and `mod` bodies
  (attribute USE inside a dependency's own files is deferred — definitions there
  work); fuel is the 1M default (the `vilan.toml [macros]` knob is pending);
  `meta::fresh` waits for its first consumer. **Findings:** i-strings escape literal
  braces as `\{`/`\}` (and span lines), so generation reads like §2's example;
  `panic` in a match arm types as `any` (B10's recorded never-type exclusion), so
  macro guards use typed fallbacks.
- **Phase 2 — invocations** — **SHIPPED 2026-07-06.** `macro name(args)` parses in
  item position (a module's top level / `mod` bodies: output parses as items and
  appends) and expression position (anywhere else, found at any depth: output parses
  as ONE expression via the `(<output>);` wrap and splices in place — the walk
  aliases the invocation to its replacement, keyed by node address). Dispatch is
  SHAPE-checked from the macro's written signature: attributes need `(Item)` /
  `(Item, Arguments)`, invocations need `(Arguments)` / `()` — mismatches are
  spanned errors in both directions. `macro_std::fresh()` yields `__m<N>`
  placeholders; the compiler stamps every placeholder unique per splice site
  (`__s<site>_m<N>`, whole-identifier match), so one site's binders cannot capture
  another's — pinned by a test where a macro REFERENCES a placeholder another site
  bound (clean "cannot find" instead of silent capture). The raw output text is
  what §6's cache stores (stamping is per-site, applied after the cache); unstamped
  output parses through a content-addressed parse cache. Failed expression sites
  walk to an error entity without a second diagnostic; "generated invalid vilan"
  errors carry a preview of the offending output. Exit criterion met: a
  `constants(..)` item family and `unroll(n, callback)` (corpus `macro-invoke.vl`),
  plus 7 inference pins. **Finding:** an unannotated closure bound to a local and
  called directly doesn't type its parameter (pre-existing; pinned as backlog B13) —
  spliced callbacks annotate their parameter until it's fixed.
- **Phase 3 — migration** (§10), one derive per commit, goldens as referee —
  **DERIVES COMPLETE (2026-07-06): all five migrated — `PartialEq`, `Default`,
  `Debug`, then `Json`+`Wire` together (one contract: the Rust `"Json" | "Wire"`
  arm), sharing their JSON impls through str-returning HELPER macro funs (§3's
  helpers, first real use — a non-macro-shaped or non-`Source`-returning
  `macro fun` compiles into the world, callable by other macros, never
  dispatched). Wire's gate was manufactured: the todo example builds
  byte-identical bundles macro-vs-Rust. **`[service]` migrated too — the stress
  test passed (2026-07-06): `Item` gained a `Service` variant whose `ServiceItem`
  carries the resolved client name, the exposure-flagged fields (`Field` gained
  `exposed`), and the same-module `[rpc]` surface GATHERED BY THE COMPILER
  (module-wide reflection stays future — a service's subject includes its rpc
  surface by the feature's own definition); the expansion cache keys on the
  struct text PLUS the gathered method texts, so a sibling method edit
  invalidates; the djb2 contract hash is computed by the macro itself in vilan
  (`str.code_at`, a new UTF-16 code-unit intrinsic with interpreter support);
  and the ~250-line generator — dispatcher, client sibling, mirrors,
  `Client::connect` with contract enforcement — is `macro fun service` plus
  helpers in `derives.vl`. Byte-gated on the todo and rpc examples
  (macro-vs-Rust bundle diff) and the live socket suites.** The seam: `expand_derives` consults the toolchain's built-in derive
  macros (`<std dir>/derives.vl` — outside the layer roots, never importable, its
  names reserved against user macros) per derive name, falling back to the Rust
  generators for anything not yet migrated (and for std fixtures without the
  file). A migrated derive generates through the expansion interpreter with the
  same cache as user macros; identical text at the same walk position keeps every
  golden byte-identical. Recorded: compiling derives.vl's own macro world
  re-enters the builtin lookup — a seeded empty placeholder terminates it (the
  world's std derives use the Rust fallback, byte-identically). The derive-name
  question (§2) settles for builtins as fn-name = trait name; a
  `proc_macro_derive`-style registration stays deferred until a user derive
  needs the decoupling. (The `derives.vl` seam described here is HISTORICAL —
  the file was dissolved into the trait modules the same week; §10 records the
  final shape.)
- **Phase 5 — the construction API** (§3's recorded direction), in adoption order:
  input accessors on `Arguments` (**SHIPPED 2026-07-06**, with the `Json`/`Wire`
  slice); **output builders — SHIPPED 2026-07-07**: `macro_std::build` (pure
  vilan, no compiler change) with `quote`/`join`/`indent` and
  `impl_of`/`fun_of`/`match_of`/`struct_of`/`init_of` — chain-by-value builders
  that render depth-0 text, containers re-indenting child text line-by-line, so
  shapes nest by rendering (`fun_of(..).expr(match_of(..).render())`). All five
  std derives and `[service]` are written against them (the escape/separator/
  indentation noise is gone from the templates); proven **byte-identical** on
  the whole corpus, the rpc example, and both todo bundles, and pinned by an
  exact-bytes e2e test (`the_output_builders_render_and_splice`). `source(str)`
  stays the escape hatch. Tree interchange (step 3) was measured and is NOT
  taken — §3 records the numbers and the batching alternative.
- **Phase 4 — `macro { .. }` blocks** — **SHIPPED 2026-07-07.** An anonymous,
  immediately-expanded macro: in item position its returned `Source` splices as
  items (comptime-style families without naming a macro); in expression
  position it splices one expression (compile-time constant folding). The body
  is hermetic macro code with the ambient meta prelude — the minimal block
  (`macro { source(..) }`) needs no imports — and calls the file's `macro fun`
  helpers as plain in-world functions. Mechanism: blocks survive world
  blanking VERBATIM (keyword included), parse at the world's top level, and
  the world hook wraps each into a synthetic `fun __macro_block_<n>(): Source`
  — true spans with zero offset arithmetic, and the content-hash world cache
  covers block bodies for free; dispatch rides Phase 2's machinery as a
  zero-argument invocation resolved by node address. Rejected loudly: blocks
  inside macro code (the enclosing body already runs at expansion time),
  non-`Source` tails (a world type error at the block), generated output
  carrying a block (anchored at the generating site, like the macro-fun rule).
  Pinned by 9 inference tests + the `macro-block.vl` corpus program (item
  family, expression fold, cross-site gensym anti-capture), which also rides
  the node-vs-interpreter equivalence gate.

**Beyond v1 (recorded, unscheduled)** — each with its trigger: **semantic
queries** (a post-inference expansion stage — the §1 non-goal; take it when a
real macro needs resolved types, not syntax); **quasi-quotation** (sugar over
`Source` — the construction API's builders cover the shapes so far);
**the compiled macro host** (§5's escape hatch — only if a real workload
outgrows the interpreter's measured microseconds-per-item); **on-disk
expansion caching** (§6's later layer — the in-memory caches already erase
re-analysis cost; take it if cold-start compiles of macro-heavy trees hurt);
and **batched expansion parsing** (the §3 step-3 measurement's cheap
alternative — fold a file's per-expansion parses into one, if a derive-heavy
first compile ever matters).

## 12. Open questions for review

1. ~~The `@` sigil~~ — **resolved (review): the `macro` keyword prefixes everything**
   (definitions `macro fun`, invocations `macro name(..)`, future blocks
   `macro { .. }`; attributes stay `[..]`). Rationale: vilan marks evaluation-mode
   shifts with keywords (`async`/`await`), not sigils — invocations read as
   `await`-family; the compile-time boundary becomes greppable by one word; no
   retired sigil returns; and the block form falls out of the grammar. Cost: `macro`
   is reserved. Parse decision is one token after `macro` (§3). Refinement (review):
   the prefix is required only in *program* code — inside the macro world, macro funs
   call each other plainly (§2).
2. ~~Fuel defaults~~ — **resolved (review), knob SHIPPED 2026-07-06:** 1M
   steps/expansion, depth 16, per-package configurable in `vilan.toml [macro]`
   (singular — the user's naming call): `fuel = <steps>`, `depth = <rounds>`.
   The entry manifest's section governs the whole compilation; a cache hit
   from a prior, better-fueled run still serves (fuel is a backstop, not a
   semantic — determinism makes the cached output valid regardless).
3. ~~Marked vs inferred macro modules~~ — **resolved (review): the question dissolved.**
   There are no macro modules: the macro world is hermetic PER FUNCTION (§3) — a
   `macro fun` sees nothing of its surrounding module and imports only from
   `macro_std`, inside its own scope. The `macro fun` head is the marker, at exactly
   the granularity the boundary is real; macros live beside the code they serve.
4. ~~Expression macros in v1 or Phase 2?~~ — **resolved (review): Phase 2 as written.**
