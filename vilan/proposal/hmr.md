## 0. What exists, and what that dictates

The dev loop today (all verified):

- **Watch** re-runs the *whole command* on any `.vl` change — a 300 ms poll, no
  incremental path (`watch-mode.md`; `crates/vilan-cli/src/main.rs`,
  `watch_loop`). `run --watch` kills and restarts the one Node child each round.
- **Emission** is one flat JS bundle per workspace leg (`dist/<name>.js`) plus a
  CSS sidecar (`dist/<name>.css`). There is **no dev static server and no emitted
  HTML** — the user's server leg serves the bundle from disk, and the HTML page is
  hand-authored source. The client boots via `main`'s body inlined at the bundle's
  tail (an async IIFE when `main` awaits).
- **Module state** emits as flat top-level `let` with **stable, source-derived
  names by default** (the `Readable` name style; only the `[build]` release preset
  mangles). Module bindings are enumerated by the analyzer
  (`module_level_bindings`) — the compiler statically knows every one.
- **The reactive runtime is std vilan**, not a JS prelude: `Signal` is two
  `Shared` cells (value + subscriber list), teardown is `Owner`-scoped, and
  `ui.mount_root` returns the root `Owner`. Disposing that owner plus clearing
  the container element is a complete unmount; nothing does both today.
- **K6 reconnect** already lets a client survive a server restart: `SocketDuplex`
  outlives the socket, redials with backoff, re-attaches mirrors, and resyncs
  their caches from the server's current values. Contract drift closes the duplex
  permanently.
- **Const-eval assets are build-only**: the `run` paths discard `const_assets`
  and never call `write_assets` (`const-eval.md` records the gap). A13's CSS
  hot-swap needs them on disk each watch round — the G2 tail is slice 0.

Two consequences drive the whole design:

1. **Whole-bundle swap is the honest v1.** There is no per-module emission and no
   component re-render unit to lean on (Solid's HMR lesson: fine-grained
   reactivity means *identity* is the feature, not module boundaries). Rebuilding
   everything is what watch already does, and full rebuilds are fast (§7 of the
   caching plan bought that). Per-module swap would require module-boundary
   emission for a payoff — preserving *local* UI state — that module boundaries
   alone don't deliver anyway. Evaluate later, don't presume (§9).
2. **Change detection by output bytes, not input analysis.** Each watch round
   rebuilds every leg (unchanged philosophy); then the *artifacts* are compared:
   server bundle bytes changed → restart the server child; client bundle bytes
   changed → push a swap; only the CSS sidecar changed → push a CSS hot-swap; no
   bytes changed → do nothing. No dependency tracking, no per-leg watchers, and
   the classification is exact by construction — the same byte-identity principle
   the corpus gate runs on.

## 1. Surface

**HMR is part of `run --watch`** for a workspace with a browser leg — no new
subcommand, no new flag to learn; `--no-hmr` opts out (plain restart-the-server
behavior, exactly today's). Rationale: `run --watch` already *means* "the dev
loop"; a separate `vilan dev` would be a second name for the same intent.
Instrumentation (§5) applies only to bundles built by an HMR-active `run
--watch`, so `build` output — and every golden — is byte-identical to today.

A single-package browser app cannot `run` today (no Node leg to execute); it is
out of v1's scope and recorded in §9 (the dev channel's static serving could
grow to cover it).

## 2. The dev channel

The CLI hosts a tiny HTTP endpoint on `127.0.0.1` (default port **35917**;
`--hmr-port` overrides) with three routes, hand-rolled on `std::net::TcpListener`
in keeping with the dependency-free watcher — SSE needs no websocket handshake,
no SHA-1, no crate:

- `GET /events` — **Server-Sent Events**. On each watch round the CLI pushes one
  event describing what changed:
  `{ kind: "swap" | "css" | "reload" | "error", version }`.
  `version` is a monotonically increasing build counter; an `error` event
  carries the rendered diagnostic text.
- `GET /bundle/<leg>.js` and `GET /asset/<leg>.css` — the current artifacts,
  served from `dist/` with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (the page origin is
  the user's server, not the CLI).

The browser side is the **dev runtime**: a small JS shim prepended to
HMR-instrumented client bundles. It installs itself once as a
`window.__VILAN_HMR__` singleton (a re-evaluated bundle reuses the live
instance), connects an `EventSource` to the embedded port, and reacts:

- `swap` → fetch the new bundle, run the swap protocol (§3).
- `css` → find the stylesheet `<link>` whose href ends in the sidecar's name and
  bump a cache-busting query param — no reload, no swap. (Requires the `<link>`
  idiom; an app that inlines its CSS gets a full `swap` instead — the byte-diff
  already classifies this correctly, since inlined CSS changes the bundle.)
- `reload` → `location.reload()` — the escape hatch the CLI can always fall back
  to, and the dev runtime's own response to any swap failure.
- `error` → show an **in-page overlay** with the diagnostic text (the terminal
  stays authoritative; the overlay is the copy for the eyes already on the
  browser). The next successful round's event clears it. (Vite's overlay,
  §7 — the single most-loved piece of its dev loop.)

On connect, the CLI sends the current `version`; the dev runtime compares it to
the version embedded in its own bundle and immediately requests a swap if stale.
This heals the fresh-tab-staleness case for free: the common serving idiom reads
`dist/client.js` once at server boot, so a new tab after a client-only edit gets
a stale bundle — which then swaps itself forward on its first heartbeat.

## 3. The swap protocol

On a `swap` event the dev runtime, in order:

1. **Capture** — read every exposed binding's transfer value (§4) from the live
   registry into a seed map `{ key → { fingerprint, value } }`. A getter that
   throws skips its binding (fresh init instead). Also record the viewport's
   scroll position and the focused element's id + selection range, when it has
   an id — best-effort continuity for the edit-and-glance loop.
2. **Teardown** — run the registered teardown list: dispose each recorded root
   `Owner` and `clear()` its container (registered by `mount_root`, §5), close
   each live `SocketDuplex`'s socket (registered at dial). Disposal clears
   subscriber lists, so any microtask still in flight from the old turn scheduler
   notifies into emptiness — inert by construction.
3. **Evaluate** — `import()` the fetched bundle text via a Blob URL (bundles are
   module scripts; top-level `let` is module-scoped, so old and new never
   collide). The new bundle's instrumented initializers consult the seed map
   (§4), its inlined `main` re-runs, remounts the UI, and re-dials RPC — a fresh
   duplex against the still-running server, so mirrors resync exactly as K6
   reconnect does today. Then restore the recorded scroll position and, if an
   element with the recorded id exists, its focus + selection — silently skip
   what no longer matches.
4. **On any failure** — teardown already ran, so don't limp: `location.reload()`.

What this preserves and what it doesn't (v1, stated honestly):

- **Preserved**: module-level state (the transfer set, §4) and everything the
  server holds — which in the full-stack idiom is most durable state; mirrors and
  `Draft` cells resync from the server on the fresh duplex.
- **Reset**: state minted *inside* functions during mount — ephemeral UI signals,
  half-typed uncommitted input, focus, scroll. Fine-grained reactivity gives
  these no stable identity to key on; inventing one (positional component
  identity) is the A7-adjacent refinement, §9. Un-pushed dirty `Draft` text is
  lost with them — recorded, with A14's debounced auto-push as the mitigation.

## 4. Identity and transfer — the A7 groundwork

**Identity.** Every module-level binding gets a compiler-minted key:
`package::module_path::binding_name` — stable across builds by construction
(source-derived), and correctly *not* stable across a rename (a renamed binding
is a new thing; it fresh-initializes). Alongside the key, a **fingerprint**: a
stable hash of the binding's canonical structural type. A seed entry is adopted
only when key *and* fingerprint match; an edit that changes a binding's type
falls back to fresh init for that binding, silently correct instead of adopting
a stale shape.

**Transfer is in-heap, not serialized.** The old and new bundle share one JS
realm, so transfer passes values by reference — no Wire bound, no codec, no
derive requirement. What makes a value *safe* to pass is that it carries no old
code: the **plain-data classification const-eval already defines** (scalars,
`str`, lists, options, structs/enums of plain data — no closures, promises,
views, resources) is reused as the transfer test, applied per binding type at
compile time:

> **Amendment (2026-07-20, S2 scout):** const-eval's classification turned out
> to be *value-level* (`value_to_const` in the interpreter — it classifies
> already-evaluated values, mid-evaluation only), so it cannot test an
> arbitrary binding's *type*. The transfer test is therefore a new
> **type-level** predicate in the analyzer, modeled on the
> `is_wire_type`/`type_is_resource` precedents, drawing the same boundary the
> const rule draws. Same semantics, different machinery — the proposal's
> "reused" was aspiration, not fact.

- plain-data binding → transfer the value itself;
- `Signal<T>` / `Shared<T>` with plain `T` → transfer the **payload**
  (`.get()` / `.read()`); the new bundle constructs a fresh cell seeded with it —
  old subscribers must not survive, only the value does;
- anything else (a closure-holding struct, a `View`, a resource — module-level
  resources are loan-only and never drop, so the old bundle's is simply
  abandoned to the realm) → not exposed, fresh init.

**The initializer-edit rule, stated.** An edit that changes a binding's
*initializer* but not its type keeps the old value — `mut counter = 0` edited
to `mut counter = 100` stays at the live count. This is the deliberate choice
every mainstream implementation converged on (React preserves state when only
a component's body changes, §7): during iteration, the value you're watching
*is* the work. The reset gesture needs no `// @refresh reset` analog either —
seed state lives only in the page's heap, so a plain browser refresh **is**
the reset, always available and always complete.

**User hooks — `std::dev`.** Vite's `hot.dispose`/`hot.data` prove the demand
for a small app-facing surface, and both ride machinery this design already
builds. Three functions, each a no-op when `window.__VILAN_HMR__` is absent
(same guarded-host-global pattern as the std registration hooks, §5):

- `dev::on_teardown(cleanup: || void)` — join the swap's teardown list. This
  is also the sanctioned patch for the zombie gap (§8): an app that starts a
  raw interval or a bare task registers its own cancel.
- `dev::stash<T>(key: str, value: T)` / `dev::take<T>(key: str): Option<T>` —
  the `hot.data` analog: app-chosen carryover under app-chosen keys (prefixed
  internally so they can never collide with binding keys). `T` is bound by
  the same transfer classification as bindings, checked at the call site —
  the type system enforces what Vite leaves to convention (no smuggling
  closures across a swap). `take` returns `None` on a fingerprint miss,
  first boot, or plain reload — and is **non-destructive** (a taken value
  stays stashed, matching Vite's persistent `hot.data`; settled at S2b).

  > **Amendment (2026-07-21, S3 review):** the "fingerprint miss" half is

Severable: if review wants a thinner v1, `stash`/`take` cut cleanly —
`on_teardown` should stay (it closes a recorded hole).

**Why this is the A7 groundwork.** Hydration needs the same two artifacts —
stable state keys and a which-values-can-cross classification — plus
serialization, because SSR crosses a process boundary. HMR proves the identity
and classification halves in-heap; A7 adds `Wire` on top. That is the reason A13
goes first, made concrete.

## 5. Compiler emission (HMR builds only)

A `BuildOptions { hmr: bool }` flag, set only by an HMR-active `run --watch` —
never by `build`, so goldens and release output are untouched. When set, for the
browser leg:

- **Prepend the dev runtime** (a fixed JS shim, like `__shared_new` — small,
  reviewed, no external fetch) with the port and build version embedded.
- **Wrap each transferable module binding's initializer**:
  `let counter = __hmr_adopt("app::counter", FP, () => 0);` — adopt returns the
  seed value on key+fingerprint match, else runs the thunk. For signal/shared
  bindings the transformer emits the seed-the-payload form.
- **Expose each transferable binding** at the module tail:
  `__hmr_expose("app::counter", FP, () => counter)` — for signals, the getter
  the transformer emits reads the payload. Getters are closures over the live
  bindings, so capture at swap time reads current values.
- **Registration hooks**: `mount_root` and the duplex dial register with the dev
  runtime's teardown list. Delivered as a `std`-internal hook that is a no-op
  when `window.__VILAN_HMR__` is absent — one guarded call each, zero cost in
  production bundles (and dead-code-free there is a nice-to-have, not a
  requirement, since production bundles aren't HMR-instrumented anyway; the hook
  compiles to a host-global check).

The interpreter needs no `__hmr_*` arms: HMR emission never runs under the
equivalence gate (it is `run --watch`-only), and the gate's builds don't set the
flag. Pin that assumption with a test asserting `build` output is byte-identical
with and without a watch-mode compile in the same process.

> **Amendment (2026-07-20, S1):** the shim is prepended CLI-side at dist-write
> time (`hmr::instrument`, called from the watch round), not via a

> module-keyed intrinsic.

## 6. Full-stack coordination

Per watch round, after rebuilding all legs (browser legs first, as today):

- **Server bundle changed** → kill + restart the Node child (existing
  machinery), then push the round's client event if any. The client survives via
  K6 reconnect; if the shared contract drifted, the client bundle necessarily
  changed too (shared source), so the same round pushes a `swap` — the fresh
  duplex dials the new contract and never hits the drift-close. A server-only
  edit leaves the client connected through one backoff cycle, exactly as today.
- **Client bundle changed, server didn't** → push `swap`; the server keeps
  running and its port stays warm.
- **Only a CSS sidecar changed** → push `css`.
- **Compile error** → push an `error` event (the overlay, §2); the terminal
  reports as today and the running app keeps its last good build — the
  standard HMR contract. The next good round's `swap`/`css` event clears the
  overlay.

> **Amendment (2026-07-21, S3):** this section assumes exactly one Node leg —

## 7. Prior art — the final pass over Vite, React, and Solid

A deliberate derivation pass (2026-07-20) over the three reference
implementations. Each lesson below is either **adopted** (woven into the
sections above), **validated** (we independently arrived at their answer), or
**rejected with cause**.

**Vite** (`import.meta.hot`: `accept`/`dispose`/`prune`/`data`/`invalidate`/
`decline`/`on`; https://vite.dev/guide/api-hmr):

- *Boundary propagation* — an update bubbles up the import graph until an
  `accept`ing module catches it; no boundary → full reload. **Rejected with
  cause**: propagation exists to avoid re-running unchanged modules, which
  presupposes per-module emission. Whole-bundle swap makes every update
  trivially "caught at the root"; we take the fallback discipline (when in
  doubt, reload) without the graph machinery.
- *`hot.dispose` + `hot.data`* — per-module cleanup and a value bag persisted
  across instances. **Adopted** as `dev::on_teardown` and `dev::stash`/`take`
  (§4), with one improvement Vite can't have: the transfer classification is
  *type-checked* at the call site, so code-bearing values can't be smuggled
  across a swap by convention-trusting user code.
- *`hot.invalidate`* — a module realizes at runtime it can't apply an update
  and escalates. **Validated**: our per-binding fingerprint miss (fresh init)
  and swap-failure → reload are the same runtime-humility principle, resolved
  statically where possible.
- *The error overlay* + guarded dev-only API (tree-shaken in production).
  **Adopted**: the `error` event + overlay (§2, §6). Our production story is
  stronger by construction — instrumentation is emitted only under
  `BuildOptions.hmr`, not stripped by a bundler convention.
- *`prune`* (cleanup for removed modules, used for CSS). Not applicable —
  whole-bundle teardown subsumes removal; the CSS sidecar swap replaces the
  whole stylesheet each round.

**React Fast Refresh** (https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh,
https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh):

- *Compiler-registered identity + a signature hash* (components registered by
  the build; hooks order/arguments hashed; a signature change resets state, a
  body-only change preserves it). **Validated, precisely**: this is our
  key + structural-type fingerprint (§4) — independent convergence on
  "identity is minted by the compiler, and a shape change means reset is
  *correct*, not a failure." Their design principles — recover gracefully
  from mistakes, fall back to a full reload when needed, no invasive
  transforms — read as a checklist this design already passes.
- *Preserve-on-body-edit* — **adopted and stated** as the initializer-edit
  rule (§4). Their `// @refresh reset` escape hatch is **rejected as
  unnecessary**: our seed state is page-heap-only, so browser refresh is a
  complete reset; React needs the directive because its state survives inside
  a long-lived runtime the user can't otherwise flush per-file.
- *"Only export components"* — a file mixing components with other exports
  degrades to reload, a real paper cut in practice. **Avoided by
  construction**: whole-bundle swap imposes no file-shape rule at all — the
  simplicity payoff of not having sub-bundle boundaries, worth naming.
- *Error-boundary retry* — after a bad render, the next edit retries in
  place. The analog we keep: a compile error never touches the running app
  (last-good-build + overlay), and the next good round swaps normally.

**Solid / solid-refresh** (https://github.com/solidjs/solid-refresh):

- The load-bearing fact: **Solid does not persist component-local state
  across HMR updates** — of React/Vue/Svelte/Solid, Solid and Svelte are the
  two that reset (solidjs/solid#2419). Fine-grained reactivity has no
  re-render unit to reattach state to; solid-refresh's default mode simply
  *remounts components in place*, and its docs recommend keeping durable
  state in module-scope stores. **Validated, strongly**: "remount the UI,
  keep module-scope state" is not our compromise — it is the reference
  fine-grained implementation's actual contract. Our v1 meets it without
  component wrappers, and exceeds it on one axis: module-keyed carryover
  survives re-evaluation of the *defining module itself*, where
  solid-refresh preserves module state only in modules the update didn't
  re-run.
- *Granular mode* — per-component code-hash signatures so unchanged
  components skip the remount. **Deferred knowingly**: this is the shape the
  §9 local-state-identity refinement would take (positional identity +
  per-unit signatures), and Solid's experience places it as incremental
  polish on the remount model, not a different foundation — which is why it
  can wait for v1 to ship and the loss to be felt, or not.

Net effect of the pass on the design: the `error` overlay (§2), the
`std::dev` hooks (§4), the initializer-edit rule stated with precedent (§4),
scroll/focus restore (§3) — plus the confidence that the two structural
choices (whole-bundle swap, module-keyed carryover) sit exactly where the
three most-worn paths in the industry ended up.

## 8. Classification, risks, non-goals

- **Closure rule**: not a model change — no new alias kind, no epoch event, no
  language semantics at all. This is tooling plus dev-only emission.
- **Zombie risk**: anything the old bundle scheduled outside owner tracking
  (a raw `set_interval` extern, a bare spawned task) keeps running after
  teardown. std's own machinery (effects, subscriptions, the duplex) is
  teardown-registered; app-level strays have the sanctioned patch
  `dev::on_teardown` (§4); a stray that registers nothing writes into
  disposed cells — inert, but recorded. If it bites in practice, the
  refinement is owner-tracking timers — independently worth considering.
- **Server-side HMR**: a non-goal, permanently — restart is the model for the
  Node leg; the process is cheap and correctness is free.
- **Security**: the dev channel binds `127.0.0.1` only and serves only `dist/`
  artifacts.

## 9. Recorded refinements (not v1)

- **Local-state identity** (positional/component keys) — the piece that would
  preserve in-flight UI state; shared design space with A7's resumable
  hydration. Evaluate after v1 ships and the loss is felt (or isn't).
- **Per-module swap** via module-boundary emission — only worth it if whole-
  bundle re-eval ever gets slow; measure first.
- **Single-leg browser dev**: grow the dev channel's static serving into a tiny
  dev server (`index.html` + bundle) so `run --watch` works without a Node leg.
- **Watch precision**: watch exactly `Program.sources` (the `watch-mode.md`
  refinement) — orthogonal, becomes more attractive as HMR tightens the loop.

## 10. Open questions — calls wanted before S1

- **(a) Surface**: HMR default-on under `run --watch` with `--no-hmr` opt-out
  (recommendation), vs opt-in `--hmr`, vs a `vilan dev` subcommand.
- **(b) Adoption miss** (key present, fingerprint changed): silent fresh init
  with a dev-runtime console note (recommendation — the binding's type changed;
  fresh is correct), vs full reload for the whole swap.
- **(c) Un-pushed `Draft` state**: accept the v1 loss (recommendation; A14's
  debounced auto-push shrinks the window), vs teardown-flush dirty drafts before
  swap (couples HMR to Draft semantics and can push half-typed state).

## 11. Slices (suite-gated, docs same commit, per-case pins)

1. **S0 — SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: `run` and `run --watch` write assets each round
   beside the canonical `<entry>.js`/`dist/<name>.js` output (not the temp
   script). Single-package `run` and the `--watch` single arm now call
   `write_assets`; the workspace paths already did via
   `build_workspace_artifacts`. Pinned per path in `crates/vilan-cli/tests/assets.rs`
   (`run_writes_assets_beside_the_output`, `workspace_run_writes_fresh_dist_css`,
   `watch_round_refreshes_the_sidecar`). Ships alone — it also fixes `run`'s
   missing-CSS gap today.
2. **S1 — SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: the dev channel (`crates/vilan-cli/src/hmr.rs`
   — SSE + artifact routes with a traversal guard, hand-rolled on
   `TcpListener`), byte-diff classification as a pure function (raw pre-shim
   bytes; server-only → restart + push nothing, K6 carries the client),
   dev-runtime shim (`hmr_shim.js`: singleton, stale-tab heal, `css`
   hot-swap via a shim-local cache-buster — css-only rounds deliberately
   don't bump the build version, so the buster can't reuse it — `error`
   overlay cleared by the next good event, `swap` = reload placeholder until
   S2). Pinned: 9 unit (every classifier case, SSE framing, traversal) + one
   bounded e2e driving swap → css → error → recovery → artifact routes.
   Residues: the `error` event carries a generic "build failed — see the
   terminal" message (capturing ariadne's rendered text needs
   `compile_to_js`/`report` to return a string — deferred; terminal output
   unchanged); the css event names no sidecar, so the shim bumps every
   stylesheet `<link>` (correct for the one-sidecar case); non-css asset
   kinds are written each round but don't classify (css is the only kind the
   runtime hot-swaps).
3. **S2 — SHIPPED 2026-07-21 in two halves.** S2a (2026-07-20): the analyzer's
   type-level transfer predicate + `pkg::module::binding` keys + structural
   fingerprints (djb2 over canonical renders, struct fields/enum variants
   expanded) + adopt/expose emission under `BuildOptions.hmr` (browser legs of
   an HMR-active `run --watch` only; A/B pinned byte-identical off). Review
   blocker fixed pre-commit: selection reuses `module_level_binding_ids`, so
   function-locals never wrap. S2b (2026-07-21): the shim's swap protocol
   (capture → teardown → Blob/`import()` → restore → fail=reload; swaps
   serialized on a promise chain against reentrancy), `std::dev`
   (`hmr_active` via the `__hmr_active` transformer helper WITH its
   interpreter arm; `on_teardown`; `stash`/`take` with the call-site
   transfer-bound check), `mount_root` + duplex teardown hooks (guarded,
   zero-cost without a shim; the reconnect-swapped socket is the one closed),
   headless ES-module e2e (20 assertions; data:-URL fallback under node) +
   6 transfer pins. **Residues:** `take` in return/argument position is
   unchecked (benign — the stash side is airtight, so a non-transferable
   `take` can only see `None`); the stash/take check fires at the lexical
   site, so a generic wrapper is rejected even with plain-data callers — the
   diagnostic names the unbounded-generic cause, per-instantiation checking
   is the refinement; `take` is non-destructive (the Vite `hot.data`
   precedent); real-browser behavior (blob import, EventSource swap,
   scroll/focus) is exercised via the node stub only — S3's kolt proof is
   the live verification.
4. **S3 — SHIPPED 2026-07-21, A13 COMPLETE.** The §6 matrix fully pinned:
   server-only → restart + provably quiet channel, shared-edit → restart +
   swap (`a_server_edit_restarts_quietly_and_a_shared_edit_swaps`; the other
   three rows were S1's e2e), deterministic 5/5. Kolt live proof: real
   `run --watch` on the real app — client edit → `swap` with S2a
   instrumentation in the served bundle (13 adopts vs 0 in a plain build),
   server edit → restart with the SSE channel surviving, tree restored
   hash-identical (a temporary `probe`-leg drop was needed — the A15
   finding, §6 amendment). Docs same commit: `guide/dev-loop.md` +
   `std/dev.md` (with the honest manual-stash caveat — the §4 S3 amendment)
   + sidebar, all examples gate-compiled. **Remaining residues live in the
   S1/S2 entries and the §4/§5/§6 amendments; the one deliberate
   verification gap is a live-browser session (blob import, EventSource,
   scroll/focus restore run under the node stub only — first real-browser
   use is the confirmation).**

## Appendix: implementation record — css hot-swap via the dev channel (2026-08-10)

**Backlog E55, css half.** S1's `css` handler (§2, `bumpStylesheets`) cache-
busted the existing `<link>`'s own `href` — which is the **user's own server
route** (`/client.css` in the todo shape), whose handler `fs::read`s it once at
boot (`examples/todo/src/server.vl`) and never again. A css-only round never
restarts that server (§6 — only a bundle change does), so the "refresh" landed
right back on the same stale bytes: exactly the hazard `fetchAndSwap` (§2's
amendment) already closed for JS, just not yet for CSS.

**Fix**: a `css` event now fetches the changed sidecar from the dev channel's
`/asset/<name>` route — which S1 already served, current every round, with
`Cache-Control: no-cache` — and applies the text as an injected `<style>` that
supersedes the matching `<link>` (`link.disabled = true`; the href itself is
never touched). A `<style>` was chosen over a `blob:` URL (the JS swap's
mechanism, §3): it updates the CSSOM synchronously with no second pass through
the browser's stylesheet loader, updates in place on a later `css` event with
no object URL to revoke, and — since the original `<link>` is only disabled,
never replaced — a plain page reload starts clean from a freshly parsed
`app.html` rather than carrying a swap artifact forward. Preserved unchanged:
the asset-matching semantics (an `asset`-named event touches only the `<link>`
ending in that filename; no name touches every stylesheet `<link>`, each
fetched by its own basename) and the never-reload discipline (a 404 or network
failure warns and leaves the current stylesheet exactly as it was — the same
reasoning `fetchAndSwap` states for a failed bundle fetch: reloading would only
re-request the user's own stale route).

No server-side change was needed — `hmr.rs`'s `/asset/<leg>.css` route and the
`css` event's `asset` field already existed (S1/§11's S3 amendment); the gap
was entirely that the shim never used them. Pinned end to end in
`crates/vilan-cli/tests/hmr.rs`
(`a_css_push_heals_a_boot_time_stale_server_route`): a server shaped exactly
like `examples/todo` (boot-time `fs::read` of `dist/client.css`) proves it is
never restarted by a css-only round and so stays observably stale, while a node
harness drives the REAL shim served by the dev channel (Node's own global
`fetch`, unstubbed, against the real running dev channel) and asserts the
applied `<style>` carries the fresh bytes — not the stale ones the server's own
route still serves. Reverting the shim change alone turns the pin red (no
`<style>` is ever produced, no request ever reaches the dev channel), so the
fix, not the harness, is what the test is anchored to.

## Appendix: implementation record — the client registry reaps its own dead (2026-08-18)

**Backlog M3**, found by the 2026-08-13 perf/leak survey. The registry
(`DevChannel.clients`) took every `/events` connection unconditionally and shed
one only as a side effect of a later broadcast failing to write to it. Between
rounds nothing on the server ever *looked* at a client, so every disconnect —
a tab refresh, a closed second tab, `EventSource`'s own native reconnect (§2's
reconnect-heals path makes those routine) — banked its socket. A dev session
that reconnects often and rebuilds rarely leaked one fd per disconnect,
unbounded.

**Measured before the fix** (`vilan run --watch` on a two-leg fixture, fds and
threads read from `/proc/<pid>`): baseline 4 fds / 4 threads; after 50
connect-disconnect cycles with no rebuild, 54 fds; after 100, 104 — one fd per
cycle, exactly. Two facts the survey's write-up did not have:

- **Threads never leaked.** The handler pushed the socket into the registry and
  *returned*, so the per-connection thread ended there. Thread count stayed 4
  across all 100 cycles. The backlog entry's parenthetical about accumulating
  per-connection threads was wrong; only fds accumulated.
- **A rebuild did not reap them.** After the first rebuild the count was still
  104. A write to a socket whose peer closed cleanly *succeeds* — the bytes
  reach the kernel and the RST answers them afterwards — so a dead client
  survives its first broadcast and leaves only on the second (measured: back to
  4 after the second rebuild). The prune was not merely late, it was a round
  behind.

**Fix**: the classic SSE idiom — the connection's own thread stays on it.
`serve_events` writes the head and the `connected` hello, registers the socket,
then blocks in `wait_for_disconnect` reading that socket until end-of-stream,
and unregisters on the way out. A browser never writes on an SSE stream, so a
read there is pure liveness: it blocks for as long as the tab lives and returns
the moment it does not. The socket is an `Arc<TcpStream>` shared between that
reader and the broadcaster (`&TcpStream` implements both `Read` and `Write`, so
no `try_clone` — which would have spent a second fd per browser to fix an fd
leak), and clients are keyed by an id rather than by their socket, because two
threads can now decide a client is finished: its reader and a failing
broadcast. Removal by id through the one mutex is idempotent, so the second
arrival is a no-op rather than a race. The broadcast-time prune stays as a
backstop and additionally `shutdown`s a socket it gives up on, so that
connection's reader returns at once instead of holding the fd.

**Cost**: one parked thread per *live* browser, where before there were none.
Measured at 10 open connections: 14 fds / 14 threads, both back to 4 / 4 the
moment they close. The accept loop already spends a thread per connection
(§2's "fine for a localhost dev tool"); this extends that thread's life to its
connection's rather than spawning anything new.

**Measured after**: 100 connect-disconnect cycles, no rebuild — 4 fds / 4
threads, unchanged from baseline, at every checkpoint.

**Pinned** in `crates/vilan-cli/src/hmr.rs`'s unit tests rather than in
`tests/hmr.rs`: the invariant is the registry's *size*, which nothing on the
wire exposes, and `vilan-cli` is a bin-only crate — an integration test cannot
reach a `DevChannel` accessor, and inventing a debug route to expose the count
would have added dev-channel surface to test the dev channel.
`a_disconnected_client_leaves_the_registry_without_a_broadcast` binds a real
ephemeral channel, opens four real SSE connections, asserts the registry holds
four (so "zero afterwards" cannot pass by never registering), drops them, and
waits for zero — three generations, and **no event is ever pushed**, which is
the whole claim. `a_live_client_stays_registered_and_receives_pushes` is the
other half: the new reader must not unregister a healthy connection, and the
id-keyed registry must still fan out. Planting the old behavior (register, then
return) turns the first pin red — `expected 0 registered client(s), found 4` —
so the fix, not the harness, is what it is anchored to.

Unchanged: the wire. Framing, the `connected` hello, `/refresh`
(`dev-refresh.md` §5–§6), the artifact routes, and every event the shim handles
are byte-for-byte what they were; all eleven `tests/hmr.rs` e2e legs pass
untouched.
