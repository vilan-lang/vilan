# Server-side rendering — render and replace (A7)

> **Status: RATIFIED 2026-07-22 — implementation starts 2026-07-23 (user
> call: too large for end of day).** The §6 calls landed per recommendation:
> (a) the process layer omits `mount_root`; (b) the shell splice stays in
> user code for v1; (c) S3 waits on demand — kolt's usage decides.
>
> Original status: DRAFT 2026-07-22 — for review. Backlog A7, reframed per
> the user's call (2026-07-22): **v1 is render + replace — hydration is not
> deferred, it is rejected.** The client never adopts server DOM; it renders
> fresh and replaces. Resumability (A7b, §7) is the recorded end-state, and
> the progression replace → resumability builds nothing hydration would have
> built: hydration's whole apparatus (adopt-in-`bind_*`, deterministic node
> addressing, mismatch reconciliation) is exactly the re-execution machinery
> resumability deletes. SEO and first paint are delivered by v1; only
> time-to-interactive waits for A7b — the same as it would under hydration.

## 0. What exists (all verified in prior arcs)

- **Platform layers shadow whole modules** (the platform model): a module
  name resolves per building platform through `search_roots`; std's browser
  layer holds `ui.vl`/`dom.vl`, and a process build importing them today gets
  the clean cross-platform error. Adding a **process-layer `ui.vl`** makes
  `import std::ui` legal on `@process` with a different implementation — the
  exact mechanism `fs`/`http` already use in reverse. A `common` library's
  component module compiles against the browser `ui` in the client leg and
  the process `ui` in the server leg with no annotation — the layer system's
  whole point.
- **`std::ui`'s browser surface**: `View { element }`, `view(tag)` builders,
  `bind_text`/`bind_attr`/`bind_each`/`when`/router boundaries — each a
  subscription writing one DOM property; `mount_root` returns the root
  `Owner`; teardown is `Owner`-scoped. `std::reactive` (signals, turns) is
  **base-layer** — it runs everywhere already.
- **The serving idiom**: the server leg reads `dist/client.js` and a
  hand-authored HTML shell from disk and serves them (walkthrough, todo,
  kolt). There is no framework server; routes are user code.
- **Wire/json**: derive-gated serialization, codec-neutral, no reflection.
- **HMR's groundwork**: compiler-minted state identity + fingerprints + the
  transferable-as-value classification — the serialization-side inputs A7b
  needs; v1 needs none of them (nothing crosses a boundary except HTML).

## 1. The v1 model — render, serve, replace

1. **Server**: the route handler calls the app's own view-building code —
   the same component functions the client runs — against the process-layer
   `ui`, which builds an **HTML string tree** instead of DOM. `render(view)`
   returns the markup. The handler splices it into the HTML shell at the
   mount point and serves it. Create-serialize-discard: no effects, no
   subscriptions, no owner survives the request.
2. **Browser, before JS**: the user (and the crawler) sees the full page.
   First paint and SEO are done. No handlers exist yet — identical to
   hydration's pre-JS window.
3. **Browser, on boot**: `mount(id, view)`/`mount_root` **clear the container
   first** (`replaceChildren`), then mount the freshly-built live UI. Since
   the same component code produced both trees, the replacement is visually
   idempotent when the data matches; when it doesn't (the data moved between
   render and boot), the replace shows the truth — which is the correct
   behavior, not a mismatch error.

No adoption, no addressing, no reconciliation. The client-side change is a
single semantic adjustment — mount clears before appending — which is a no-op
for every existing app (their containers are empty).

## 2. The process-layer `ui` (the one real piece of work)

A second `ui.vl` in std's process layer, same public surface, over a string
tree:

- `View` wraps a **node record** (tag, attributes, children, text) instead of
  a DOM `Element`; `view(tag)`, `.child`, `.text`, `.attr`, `.class` build it.
- **`bind_*` reads once**: `bind_text(signal)` takes `signal.get()` and
  embeds it as text — no subscription is created (nothing to notify; the
  value at render time is the value served). `bind_each` renders the current
  list; `when` renders the taken branch; `bind_draft`/event handlers (`on`,
  `on_event`) **accept and discard** — a server render of a button is just
  `<button>` (its handler is client business).
- `mount`/`mount_root` do not exist server-side... or exist as errors?
  **Call (§6a)**: the process `ui` either omits them (a component calling
  `mount_root` is a client entry, not a renderable view — the natural
  factoring is `fun app(): View` shared, `main` differs per leg) or defines
  them as compile-time-absent so the error is clear. Recommendation: omit;
  the missing-member error already names the module and platform.
- **`render(view: View) -> str`** — the serializer: proper escaping (text
  nodes and attribute values), void elements (`<br>`, `<img>`…), and
  attribute ordering **deterministic** (insertion order — the components
  wrote them in code order, both sides identical by construction).
- `std::dom` stays browser-only. A component reaching for raw DOM cannot
  SSR, and the existing cross-platform gate says so at the `import` with the
  standard error — the correct boundary, free of charge.
- The maintenance cost, stated: two `ui` implementations whose *rendered
  output* must correspond. The gate is a differential pin (§4): the same
  view built both ways — the browser one under the A10 DOM stub, the server
  one via `render` — must produce equal trees (tag/attr/text structure).

## 3. What v1 explicitly does not do

- **No hydration** — rejected, not deferred (§0).
- **No initial-state embedding** (the double-fetch stands in v1): the client
  re-fetches via rpc on boot exactly as today, and a data change between
  render and boot shows as a content update. The fix — serializing initial
  store data into the HTML and adopting it client-side (`Wire` + a
  `<script type="application/vilan-state">` blob) — is **S3, its own slice
  with its own calls (§6c)**, because it introduces a cross-process state
  contract v1 doesn't need.
- **No streaming/suspense**, no partial rendering, no router integration
  (the server route matches the path and picks which view to render by
  hand; A10's enum-route model composes with that today — a `match` on the
  route enum server-side — and deeper integration waits for demand).
- **No pre-JS event capture** — clicks before boot do nothing (same as
  hydration; A7b's event-replay closes it).

## 4. Slices (suite-gated, docs same commit, per-case pins)

1. **S1 — SHIPPED 2026-07-23**: `vilan/std/src/process/ui.vl` (295 lines) —
   the full read-once surface (`bind_text/class/attr/value/draft`,
   `bind_each`/`when`/`swap`/`show`, `style_var`), handlers accepted and
   discarded, `mount`/`mount_root` omitted per §6a. `render`: insertion-order
   attributes, text/attr escaping, the void set (children of a void drop
   silently — the recorded §5 risk). 22 pins + corpus `ssr-render.vl`
   (equivalence-gated) + the cross-implementation differential
   (`ssr_differential.rs`: property→attribute canonical mapping, browser-stub
   tree ≡ rendered string **byte-for-byte**) + the `std::dom` platform-gate
   pin; docs in `guide/ui.md` same commit. One §2 amendment settled in
   flight: `on_event` must be MIRRORED-and-discarded, not omitted — a
   process program may import a browser module (the router) it never calls
   into, and requirement analysis loads it; the handler's event type stays
   generic (a discarded handler never touches it). Residue: `style_var` is
   snapshot-pinned but outside the differential (the DOM stub no-ops
   `style.setProperty`).
2. **S2 — replace semantics + the full-stack proof**: `mount`/`mount_root`
   clear first (pin: mounting into a container with existing children
   replaces them; every existing example unaffected); the walkthrough (or a
   new `examples/ssr`) server renders its initial view into the shell at the
   mount marker; a CLI e2e asserts the served HTML **contains the rendered
   content before any JS runs** (curl the route, assert markup), and the
   A10 headless stub then boots the client bundle and asserts the container
   was replaced with the live UI (old server nodes gone, bindings firing).
   kolt as the real-world adoption once the example proves the loop.
3. **S3 (optional, gated on §6c) — the initial-state blob**: server
   `embed`/client `adopt` over `Wire`, keyed like HMR's stash; the client's
   first fetch skipped when the blob answers. Recorded here so its absence
   in v1 is a decision, not an oversight.

## 5. Risks, named

- **Output divergence between the two `ui`s** — held by the S1 differential
  pin; any new `bind_*` must land in both layers or the pin fails.
- **The replace flash** — real but small: same code + same data ⇒ identical
  markup swap (imperceptible); different data ⇒ an honest update. Transient
  pre-JS input/media state is lost at the swap — documented, accepted for
  v1 (the HMR scroll/focus restore machinery exists if it ever matters).
- **Server-side signal misuse** — a component that *writes* signals during
  build runs identically server-side (signals are base-layer); effects
  don't attach, so nothing leaks — but a component relying on effect
  side-channels at build time renders stale. The docs page states the rule:
  build pure, bind reactive.

## 6. Open calls — wanted before S1

- **(a) `mount_root` server-side**: omit from the process layer
  (recommendation — the natural `fun app(): View` factoring makes it
  unreachable) vs defining a clear compile-error stub.
- **(b) The splice API**: v1 keeps the shell splice in user code
  (`shell.replace("<!--app-->", render(app()))` — recommendation: honest,
  zero new surface) vs a `render_into(shell, marker, view)` convenience in
  std.
- **(c) S3 in this arc or on demand**: recommendation — build S1+S2, ship,
  and let kolt's real usage decide whether the double-fetch hurts enough to
  pull S3 forward.

## 7. A7b — resumability (recorded, not planned)

The end-state: the server serializes the reactive graph and handler wiring
so the client executes **nothing** at boot — handlers wake lazily, by
address, on first interaction. vilan's position is unusually strong: closure
conversion is compiler-owned, so handler-splitting is a compiler pass, not a
bundler trick; HMR's identity/fingerprint/transfer machinery is the
serialization substrate; `Wire` is the codec. The missing pieces are the
compiler pass (stable handler addresses + captured-environment
serialization), the wake runtime, and pre-boot event capture/replay. It
replaces §1's step 3: instead of render-fresh-and-replace, the client keeps
the server DOM and wires it lazily. Nothing in v1 obstructs it, and nothing
in v1 is discarded by it — the render-only `ui` and the replace semantics
remain the fallback for non-resumable pages and the dev loop.
