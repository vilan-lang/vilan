# The diagnostics ledger (diagnostics-standard.md §5)

Every `diagnostics.push` site, its message head, and its audit verdict.
Verdicts: **QUALIFIES** (rules met, pin cited) · **RE-ANCHOR** (fails
A-rules) · **REWORD** (fails B-rules) · **DEMOTE** (cascade) ·
**NOTE-NEEDED** (wants C3) · *(blank = unreviewed)*. Line numbers are the
snapshot at generation; the message head is the stable key. Updated per
audit batch, in the batch's commit.

**Batch 7 (continuation), 2026-07-21.** The standard's "180/180 —
AUDIT COMPLETE" is the 2026-07-16 snapshot. The arcs that shipped after it
(C4 resources/destruction, R11 generic-resource, B29 conformance, A13 HMR
transfer, R12 resource-`any`, the async-polymorphism transitive checks)
added 23 new `diagnostics.push` sites — enumerated by diffing `9f59099..HEAD`
(20 new analyzer messages + 3 async_infer; the two `[rpc]`-Wire sites and the
`async` closure-type-position site only relocated). All 23 verdict QUALIFIES:
each was born inside a proven, pinned arc and already follows the B-rules
(rendered types, one-action steers, rule statements) with a family pin; span
quality spot-checked (B29 anchors at the offending parameter/return). The
five `could not be resolved` residual rows (142–145, 147) are finalized
**DEMOTE** — the `!self.diagnostics.is_empty()` guard suppresses them behind
any real error, verified with a multi-use-site pin. No new cross-source note
producer points into `std` for a user-caused condition (backlog item 11 /
E11): the only into-`std` notes are the bound- and trait-declaration notes,
both control cases — see that item's finding.

**H6 S5 cutover, 2026-07-21.** The handwritten frontend (`frontend.md`) replaces
chumsky at the S5 cutover; its parse diagnostics (`parsing::parse` +
`parsing::render`) now flow through the pipeline's fold sites (`analyze_source`,
the module loader, macro expansion, the CLI report), replacing chumsky's
`render_parse_error`. Five message forms go live (204–208), all QUALIFIES — the S4
error-quality pass built them to the standard (found/expected/context/hint, curated
expectations with none of chumsky's `context clause` / `generic arguments` noise, a
structural `!=`-soup hint, the B6 misplaced-`resource` rule), and the S5 review
added FIX 1 (a recovered CLOSED delimited region surfaces its real *located* inner
error when a committed demand or leaf recorded one — never a false "unclosed" on a
missing separator/typo; only a GENUINELY GARBLED region, declining at its first
token, falls back to the production-naming "unclosed" last resort) and FIX 2 (the
committed close demands — closing `) ] } >` via `expect_ctrl`, a closure's `|` via
`expect_op`, and each list's `,` separator — record what they wanted, so a missing
separator steers to "`,` or <closer>" at the offending token instead of the leading
keyword; opening delimiters and item keywords stay silent, keeping the expected set
curated). Pins: `parsing.rs` `render_*` (8) + `inference.rs` the three steers
(`the_not_equals_soup_hints…`, `an_unclosed_generic_steers…`,
`a_missing_parameter_comma_steers…`).
