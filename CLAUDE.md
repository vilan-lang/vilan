# vilan

Rust project: a compiler/interpreter for the "vilan" language.

## Engineering principles

This project prioritizes **correctness and long-term maintainability over speed of delivery**,
and it can afford to — there is no deadline pressure. Hold the bar high:

- **Correctness over quickness.** Never rush a feature. A slower, correct, well-understood
  implementation always beats a fast one that mostly works. The project can afford the time.
- **Refactoring is the preferred path.** Refactoring is a *good thing*. When technical debt or an
  awkward abstraction makes a feature hard to implement cleanly, pay the debt down first rather
  than building around it. The project can afford it. The codebase only grows more feature-dense
  over time, so maintainability is a primary goal, not an afterthought — it is what keeps the
  whole thing tractable.
- **Prove a feature before implementing it.** A new feature should be *proven* first: a formal
  definition of its semantics, then unit tests and regression tests that pin that behavior down.
  Design on paper (a proposal in the `proposals` sibling repo,
  `proposals/proposal/…`), settle the semantics, then build.
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** A bug fix must address the underlying cause. Do not paper
  over a failure with a special-case patch that handles one input — find why the *general* path is
  wrong and fix that. Special cases are a smell; prefer general code that subsumes them.

## Conventions

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use full variable names like `parameter` over abbreviations like `p`.
- Run `cargo fmt` after every change. It may reformat pre-existing code that was not part of the change — that is expected and desired.
- Clean up surrounding code when it's reasonable to do so (rename unclear identifiers, remove dead code, simplify logic, etc.).

## Testing

- Regression test files live in `vilan/test/`. Their `.mjs` goldens are a **byte-identical** gate, enforced by `cargo test -p vilan-cli --test corpus` (part of the full suite — it builds every corpus program with the current binary and compares bytes): a change that alters them is either a bug or a deliberate, verified improvement — regenerate a golden only after confirming the new output is correct (and rebuild the debug binary first, or a stale binary writes wrong goldens).
- **Add unit tests for critical code.** Any change to a critical subsystem — the type solver / analyzer (`crates/vilan-core/src/analyzer.rs`), the transformer / codegen (`src/transformer.rs`), the language server (`crates/vilan-lsp/`), and the lexer/parser — must come with unit tests that pin its behavior, including the **edge cases** (the multi-parameter, nested, mixed, and ordering-sensitive forms — not just the happy path). The compiler-behavior harness lives in `crates/vilan-core/tests/inference.rs` (`assert_compiles`, `assert_compiles_and_runs`, `assert_fails`); a known-but-unfixed bug is pinned as an `#[ignore]`d test and un-ignored when fixed.
- **Docs are gated and part of done.** Every fenced example in `vilan/docs/` is compiled by `cargo test --test docs`; a change to std, a framework, or the language updates the affected docs page **in the same commit** (see `proposals/proposal/documentation.md`).
- **"Fixed" and "closed" require a pinned test — per case, not per example.** Do not claim a bug fixed, or a class of bugs closed, on the strength of a green suite plus one representative program. Each distinct case needs its own passing (or, if still open, `#[ignore]`d) test. Edge cases without a test are how a "closed" item silently regresses or turns out never to have been covered.

## Running the suite

`cargo nextest run --workspace` is the gate — ~40 test binaries each linking
the full crate, a ~100-program corpus built through the debug binary, a docs
gate compiling every fence, and e2e legs that bind ports and spawn servers.
nextest interleaves every binary's tests across all cores (fail-fast is off
via the committed `.config/nextest.toml`), which is what took the suite from
131 s to ~64 s (E21/E25–E27, `proposals/proposal/suite-speed.md`) — still expensive.
Run it when it is the right instrument, not as a way of finding out what you
just did. Two instrument notes: nextest does not run doc-tests (all empty
today; CI's `cargo test --workspace --doc` leg guards the gap), and plain
`cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` remains a correct, slower
equivalent.

- **Never pipe it through `grep`, `head`, or `tail` and read the exit code.**
  The pipeline reports the *filter's* status, so a red suite looks green — this
  has produced real "all green" claims over genuine failures. Redirect and check
  the runner's own code:
  `cargo nextest run --workspace > suite.log 2>&1; echo $?` — then grep
  the log. Same trap with `cargo build`.
- **Run it once, at the end, after every edit is done.** A run started
  mid-editing tests a tree that no longer exists, and finishing it teaches you
  nothing about the tree you have. If you edit after starting one, kill it.
- **Pay the cheap gate before the expensive one.** Most failures are
  predictable from what you touched, and the targeted binary costs seconds where
  the suite costs minutes:
  - added or bumped a dependency → `cargo test -p vilan-cli --test third_party_notices`
    (the lockfile must stay covered by `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`; regenerate with
    `cargo about generate about.hbs -o THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`)
  - touched the transformer / codegen → `cargo test -p vilan-cli --test corpus`
  - touched the analyzer / type solver → `cargo test -p vilan-core --test inference`
  - touched std, a framework, or the language → `cargo test -p vilan-core --test docs`
  - touched module loading or paths → `cargo test -p vilan-core --test module_resolution`
- **`cargo build` first when the change might not compile.** A failed build
  inside `cargo test` costs the same as a successful one and tells you less.
- **A new pin should be proven non-vacuous**, and that is cheap: plant the bug
  the fix removes, watch the pin go red, restore. Do it with the targeted
  binary, never by re-running the suite.
