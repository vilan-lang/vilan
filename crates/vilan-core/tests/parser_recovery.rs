//! Per-site parser/lexer recovery pins (H6 S0, `proposal/frontend.md` §3).
//!
//! The handwritten frontend that replaces chumsky (H6) must reproduce the
//! CURRENT parser's recovery behavior byte-for-byte. §0 of the proposal notes
//! that only the trailing-`.` member case (`member_completion_on_incomplete_receiver`
//! in vilan-lsp) is pinned as an observable today; the ten `nested_delimiters`
//! sites, the `?.` sibling, the misplaced-`resource` steer, and the lexer's
//! skip-then-retry are exercised only indirectly. These pins make each one an
//! explicit contract, asserting — against the handwritten `parsing::parse` (which
//! S4 gave recovery; through the arc these also ran against the chumsky oracle,
//! now deleted — see `frontends`) — that a garbled input at the site:
//!   (a) does NOT hard-fail (a partial tree comes back),
//!   (b) recovers to the documented placeholder (empty vec / `None` / `Node::Error`
//!       / empty block), and
//!   (c) reports a diagnostic (the error is not swallowed) — for the member cases
//!       the diagnostic surfaces during analysis, so those are pinned at both the
//!       parse level (tree shape) and the analyze level (see the analyze module).
//!
//! Diagnostic *counts and wording* are deliberately NOT over-pinned: proposal §6(a)
//! allows parse errors to improve at cutover. The pins assert "at least one error",
//! never an exact count. Recovered-tree *spans* ARE part of the contract (the S0
//! differential harness is span-inclusive) so the shape substrings carry them.
//!
//! Every recovered shape below was captured from the current binary, not asserted
//! from reading (H6 S0 is probe-first).
