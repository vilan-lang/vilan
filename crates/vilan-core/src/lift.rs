//! The expression-lifting region rewrite (proposal/expression-lifting.md).
//!
//! A bare postfix `?` parses as a `Node::Lifted` mark; this pass — pure
//! Node → Node, run once per parsed tree before analysis — turns every marked
//! slot-root expression into a `Node::LiftRegion`: an ordered step list
//! (`Eval` steps hoisting effect-capable material that precedes a later `?`,
//! so source evaluation order holds; `Split` steps for the receivers) over a
//! residual body skeleton whose `LiftHole(i)` nodes reference step results.
//!
//! The slot rules (§2/§6 of the proposal): a region never crosses a slot
//! boundary — a `let` initializer, a call argument, an index expression, a
//! struct field, a list/tuple element, a condition, a match subject, a branch
//! or block tail each root their own region — and a recorded paren group
//! (`Node::LiftGroup`) seals its interior as a region of its own. Chain-form
//! `?.` lifts (`Node::Lift`) are sealed atoms: their value participates in a
//! region container-typed, never absorbed (§5 — `a?.b == None` keeps its
//! meaning).
//!
//! A mark in a position this pass does not handle is left in place; the
//! analyzer's walk reports it as a clean "not supported here" diagnostic —
//! sound by construction, never silent.
