//! Platform coloring — function-granular platform admission
//! (proposal/platform-coloring.md, phase 1).
//!
//! Replaces import-site gating for application builds: a build may *load* any
//! module of any layer (they already load for typing), but every function
//! **reachable from the entry** must be runnable on the build platform. A
//! function's requirement is seeded by its definition site — an item defined
//! in a library layer's module requires that layer's platforms; base-layer
//! and user code are unconstrained — and the requirement travels by
//! reachability rather than a fixpoint:
//!
//! - Resolved calls descend into the callee.
//! - Trait/generic-bounded dispatch descends into every **candidate** (the
//!   impls' members and the trait default — `async_infer`'s rule; sound
//!   over-approximation, per-instantiation refinement recorded in the
//!   proposal).
//! - A call through a closure *value* descends nowhere: a closure's body was
//!   already charged to the function that **created** it (the v1 creator
//!   rule), which the walk reaches lexically via the closure-parent links.
//! - A **module-level binding** is reached by *reference*: its initializer
//!   runs iff something reachable references it (F6 — the same rule emission
//!   uses), so a reference is an edge, and the initializer's calls, created
//!   closures, and references to other bindings are the binding's out-edges.
//!   A `const`-marked initializer runs in the compile-time interpreter, not
//!   on the build platform — it has no edges and seeds nothing.
//!
//! A violation reports the call chain from the entry (backlog §E.8's
//! standard), anchored at the deepest call site in **user** code.
//!
//! [`requirements`] is the same reachability turned into tooling data: an
//! entry-independent per-function map of rendered requirement lines (what the
//! language server shows on hover), computed caller-ward from the seeds so
//! every function gets a shortest witness chain to the layer it requires.
