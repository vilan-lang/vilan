//! A static call graph over the analyzed program: which functions and closures
//! each function/closure calls. Built from the resolved [`Program`] after type
//! checking, it is the foundation for interprocedural effect analyses — the
//! `context` value-threading pass, and later async inference. Both ask the same
//! question, "which functions transitively reach a leaf site?", which is just
//! backward reachability over these edges.
//!
//! Edges are only as precise as call resolution allows. A call through a value
//! (a closure or function held in a variable, parameter, or field), a generic
//! `T::member()` dispatch, or a trait-method re-dispatch can't be pinned to a
//! single callee statically; those are recorded as [`CallTarget::Indirect`] so a
//! consuming pass can refuse to thread through them rather than silently miss
//! them.
//!
//! Granularity is deliberately pre-monomorphization: a generic function is one
//! node, not one per instantiation. An effect is a property of the function, not
//! of a particular type substitution, so every instance inherits whatever the
//! pass decides for the single node.
