//! The handwritten parser (H6 S3 + S4, `proposal/frontend.md` §2 "Parser" + §3).
//!
//! A dependency-free, single-pass recursive-descent + precedence-climbing parser
//! over `&[(Token, Span)]` (the output of [`crate::lexing::tokenize`], which S1
//! proved byte-identical to the chumsky lexer). It produces the same
//! `Spanned<Node>` tree — spans included — that the chumsky grammar in `parser.rs`
//! produces, which stays in-tree as the oracle for the whole H6 arc (deleted at
//! S5). Nothing in the pipeline calls this yet; it is exercised by the corpus-
//! scale differential (`tests/parse_differential.rs`, which S3 repoints at this
//! module), the corpus-through-the-new-frontend byte gate
//! (`tests/corpus_new_frontend.rs`), the recovery pins (`tests/parser_recovery.rs`,
//! S4-repointed to run against BOTH frontends), the recovery-mode differential
//! (`tests/parse_recovery_differential.rs`), and this module's own pins.
//!
//! S4 adds RECOVERY and rich errors on top of the clean grammar: the
//! `nested_delimiters` sites reproduce their placeholders ([`Parser::recover_delimited`]),
//! the top-level parse keeps whatever prefix parsed, and [`ParseError`] carries the
//! found/expected/context/hint a real renderer ([`render`]) needs — messages that
//! may IMPROVE on chumsky's (§6a), never wired into the pipeline (that is S5).
//!
//! `editing-dx.md` S1 finishes the recovery design `frontend.md` §2 ratified and
//! the cutover left unbuilt: **statement/item boundaries synchronize on
//! `;`/`}`/item keywords** ([`Parser::recover_statement`]). Both statement loops
//! used to `break` on the first statement that declined, which is what the survey
//! measured as the *blackout* — while a file does not parse, everything after the
//! break stops being analyzed, so the diagnostics the rest of the file already had
//! disappear from the editor. They now report that statement, skip to the next
//! boundary and resume, which retired the block site's region-skipping recovery
//! (nine `nested_delimiters` sites remain: a body salvages statement by statement
//! instead of collapsing to an empty block).
//!
//! With S3 the grammar is COMPLETE — the whole file, not just its expressions.
//! S2 covered the *expression* and *type* grammar plus the block-bearing forms
//! (`closure`/`if`/`for`/`match`/block/`let`/assignment/`ret`/`jump`). S3 fills the
//! seam: top-level *items* (`fun`/`struct`/`enum`/`impl`/`trait`/`mod`/`import`/
//! `use`/`export`), the bracket-attribute grammar (`[derive(..)]`/`[service(..)]`/
//! `[extern(..)]`/`[platform(..)]`/`[must_use]`/`[rpc]`/`[trait_only]`/`[doc(..)]`/
//! `[expose]` and user macro attributes), the *macro forms* (`macro fun`/`macro
//! { }`/`macro name(..)`), and the deferred `tuple_comprehension` atom. The
//! statement/item interleaving reproduces the chumsky `statement` choice ORDER
//! exactly — the attribute/macro/export forms lead, then `expression ;` (and the
//! block-bearing statement forms), then the declaration items — because that
//! order decides which reading of an ambiguous `[`- or `async`-led head wins.
//!
//! Faithfulness over improvement: every shape here reproduces the chumsky grammar,
//! quirks included (the split-shift reassembly, the H.1 struct-literal-free
//! condition mode as a boolean rather than a parallel grammar, the collect-then-
//! group `?.` continuation, the arrow-less closure *type*, the paren-dissolving
//! atom that keeps the inner expression's own span, `apply_binding_mutability`
//! leaving array binders untouched, the FIXED attribute order on a function, the
//! optional `;` on a `macro`-statement vs the mandatory one on an expression, the
//! `resource`-misplaced steer). Ugly-but-reproduced behaviours are recorded for
//! the S4/S5 error-quality pass, not fixed. The differential is the referee.

    /// source nesting. In SOURCE terms the headroom is the larger figure; 21.7x
    /// is the conservative way to state it, so it is the one stated.
    ///
    /// It is deliberately the SAME number as `WALK_DEPTH_LIMIT`, though the two
