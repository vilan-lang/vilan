    //   - **No platform.** A library declares no `target`; it is compiled once

    //     <library>`, `check_library_contract`) is what verifies that. The

    //     infer from the file's own imports — instead of inventing a target and
    //     reporting coloring violations the library never committed to.
    //   - **One root, the file's own layer.** `pkg::` resolution for the
    //     ENTRY's package searches a single directory (only a *dependency* gets
    //     the layered `search_roots`), so a file is rooted at the layer it
    //     lives in — its base layer, or the platform layer containing it. A
    //     module therefore reaches its own layer's siblings and not the other
    //     layers'. Reaching both needs the entry package to carry a layered
    //     spec, which is the deferral above; rooting at the file's own layer is
    //     the subset that never resolves less than the no-project fallback did.
