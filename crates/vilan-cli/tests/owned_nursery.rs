//! End-to-end for `OwnedNursery` and detached-mode reporting (destruction.md
//! §9, C4 S4b). An `OwnedNursery` owns the tasks spawned inside `enter`;
//! dropping it cancels them (bridged IO aborts, frames unwind, drops run), and
//! its nursery runs DETACHED — never joined — so a real child failure reports
//! to the console with its spawn origin instead of being silently absorbed, and
//! children do not cancel their siblings. Cancellation echoes stay silent.
//!
//! These run real `node` processes (timers, the AbortSignal bridge, the deferred
//! console report), so they live here rather than in the inference harness.
