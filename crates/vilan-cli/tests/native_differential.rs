//! The native backend's exit test (tracker F1, slice S1a; `native-apps.md`
//! §5-S1): every program the Rust emitter ACCEPTS prints, as a native binary,
//! byte-identical stdout to the same program compiled by the JS backend.
//!
//! # Why this is the right gate
//!
//! It needs no new oracle. `ssr_differential` proves a second `std::ui`
//! implementation by compiling one program two ways and comparing bytes; this
//! is the same shape applied to a BACKEND rather than to a platform, and the
//! corpus it runs over is the one the whole project already trusts to say what
//! a program means (`vilan/test/`, whose rule is that a program terminates and
//! its output is its claim).
//!
//! # The three verdicts, and why a REFUSAL is one of them
//!
//! S1a's emitter is a first cut. Over the corpus, a program lands in exactly
//! one of three places:
//!
//! * **refused** — the emitter names a construct it does not reach (a generic
//!   function, a module-level binding, `async`, a host binding) and answers an
//!   error. Recorded, not failed: naming the gap is what turns it into S1b's
//!   work list, and [`the_refusals_are_named_and_counted`] prints the census.
//! * **identical** — compiled both ways, same bytes. The claim.
//! * **anything else** — a program the emitter accepted and then got wrong, or
//!   emitted Rust that rustc will not build. **That is a failure**, and it is
//!   the only thing this file lets through as one. A backend that quietly
//!   prints a different number is worse than a backend that refuses.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! rustc is ~1 s per program even in debug, so the default suite runs a handful
//! and `VILAN_NATIVE_DIFFERENTIAL=1` runs the whole corpus (the seal does). The
//! `vilan-rt` build is shared through one `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` under
//! `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`, so the runtime compiles ONCE for the whole sweep
//! rather than once per program.
